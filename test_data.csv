1700,"Although I can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips, they are a good alternative and very tasty. The flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store; it is the texture that is different. They are less oil (a good thing) and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper. All of the flavors are good except for the cheese one. I didn't care for it although my two-year-old likes it.<br /><br />All-in-all, for the calories, you can't beat it, and for long term weight maintenance and health, these are great and delicious as well. Amazon.com sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store.",food
1701,The chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and Weight Watcher point value.,food
1702,"I was on the fence about buying these for months. I read the reviews and were impressed by them but, the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips I hated made me nervous. This was my first food order from amazon and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again.",food
1703,"I picked up a 3 oz bag of the Salt and Vinegar chips last weekend at Wegman's and in a blink of an eye, the bag was GONE.  Very nice vinegar flavor.  Bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  I ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size (single serving) to help with portion control.  Most of the flavors I like - but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is VERY garlic. Love the salt and pepper.  With 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  Try it - you will like it.",food
1704,"Popchips are really, really good! Don't expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but DO expect something equally AWESOME that stands on its own. Popchips don't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other ""diet"" chips, and they don't have a lot of fat and calories - only 100 cal. per single-serve bag! I got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors - some better than others (because I'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by ANY maker, so these were as good as any), but all were good, most were GREAT. Even non-dieters who tried them liked them. It seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that's because I had to buy a case. Even so, they're worth it if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo-cal indulgence you wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy. My recommendation: EAT POPCHIPS!",food
1705,"Here's the straight talk from a foodie, not a Top Chef food critic, but a foodie:<br />-Name: Pop Chips. They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.<br />-Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the ""potato"" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste.<br />I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity.",food
1706,"I ordered these chips due to other readers reviews being so good. In addition, my pregnant wife and I enjoy foods that are portioned and easy for taking on the go. But the main reason I ordered these chips was that they are a health conscious choice and the flavor does not disappoint!

1707,"I hate to type this, because there are so many people that really enjoy this product, but take a look at the ingredients in this so-called ""all-natural"" product. I have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me, so that is the only flavor I can vouch for right now.  About halfway down the list of ingredients you'll see ""yeast extract."" Unfortunately, this is the new MSG.  Many people are still unaware of this fact and ""natural"" food companies are taking advantage.  It is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary.  Google ""MSG yeast extract"" for yourself, or check out [...].",food

1709,"These are to potato chips as Pringles are to chips; as instant coffee is to brewed coffee; and Stephen Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin - same family but scant resemblance.  So I'd buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.  PS: the flavors are OK but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the Jersey Turnpike.",food
1710,"Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up.",food
1711,"We tried these chips because DR. OZ had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative.  My whole family loves them, we have not found a flavor that we don't like.  These are WAY better than any baked style chip.  Try them and you won't be disappointed!",food
1712,"These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day!",food
1713,MY kids loved these and they were such a great deal. I didn't feel so guilty about giving my kids chips!!,food
1714,"Like many others, we were on the fence about buying these Popchips, with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat.  Turns out though we enjoy them all, the kids like the plain ones, saying they taste like Pringles, and my wife and I are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt.  We are not fans of BBQ chips in general, but still ate the BBQ Popchips.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again",food
1715,Everyone should try these chips. They are healthier than regular chips. And they taste good.,food
1716,"This was our first time trying Popchips, but I had heard so many good things about them so I was eager to try them.  We ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors.  My kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar.  My favorite by far is the BBQ flavor.  We love popchips here!!!",food
1717,"These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. You get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer, they are GREAT, only 2 points for each bag!!!",food
1718,Possibly THE best salt and vinegar chips (healthy or not) ever!  The salt is just right and compliment the vinegar's tartness perfectly.<br /><br />All the chips are good.. salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming.,food
1719,"These are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market. It's not greasy, doesn't leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market.  First time time tasting it was during the Natural Product Expo West 2009 in Anaheim, fell in love with it almost right away.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about this product was probably the price, which is higher compared to chips of other brands.  In addition, the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety pack.<br /><br />Amazon's pricce on this item, along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost instantaneously.  if you have a costco nearby, you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price, slightly higher than what Amazon offers though.",food
1720,"This variety pack is perfect for when you want something crunchy and salty.<br />The selection of flavors were great choices for me - I liked them all.<br />The portion keeps you from overeating, and they are healthier for you than<br />potato chips, even the baked ones.<br />I recommend these and will be buying them again and again.",food
1721,The popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. They are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. Great for dieters. Fits in with a low calorie diet. Definitely would recommend trying at least once.,food
1722,Totally amazing and very delicious.<br /><br />My favorite flavors (from best to worst):<br /><br />1. barbecue<br />2. sour cream and onion<br />3. cheddar<br /><br />4. salt and pepper<br />5. original<br />6.  vinegar and sea salt,food
1723,Salt and Vinegar and BBQ rock!  Plain were OK....Didn't really care for Cheddar.  Nice to start w/a variety pack to find the ones you prefer.,food
1724,"If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Suprisingly, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer. Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! This is a really nice product.",food
1725,"I got these for $10 for the 24 pack, so a pretty good deal. They are about as healthy as the baked chips I usually buy.  They all taste great and Im officially a fan.<br /><br />It's pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked.  So they do have some ""air"" in them.  .8 ounce bags is slightly more than the .75 ounches in baked lays bags I was buying.<br /><br />Good buy if you can get a good deal like I did",food

1728,Excellent taste for a low calorie snack.  This size bag is exactly 100 calories and you get a lot of chips.  I prefer these to the regular greasy chips.,food
1729,I expected..idk..maybe tasteless cardboard...but these are really good..i have only tried the bbq so far..but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag!  I will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking..my only caveat is..these could prove to be addictive..i am looking to watch my weight..and these are definitely a temptation!  Very happy with this product:),food
1730,"I order these chips on a regular basis.  If you are doing Weight Watchers, these chips are 2 points a bag.  When this particular shipment arrived at my house, it was poorly packaged.  I received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  This is the 1st time in the four times that I've ordered these, hopefully it won't happen again.",food

1734,"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches.",food
1735,"When I found these chips I was shocked to see how little fat there is in these. They taste great and the are actually not bad for you either. I told my sister, and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them. We order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines, the office loves them. They can be a little hard to find, that why I order the online.",food
1736,"This 24-pack lasted about a month, and I sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once, as it is my wife's and my favorite. So, I reordered just the barbecue. Great snack for 100 calories. I've purchased the reduced fat Pringles 100-calorie individual packs before, and you get a lot more chips in a Popchips bag than from Pringles.",food

I am on a calorie counting diet along with my Husband and we eat the popchips almost every day. I like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you...alot better then baked or fried.  I am sold and really enjoy them...you came up with a fantastic product.  Sincerely, Viki Crabtree",food
1747,"Pop-Chips are VERY GOOD!  I'm on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks.  I think I even like these better than regular chips!  The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and I'm not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I don't really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I don't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.<br /><br />Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I don't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well.",food
1748,"My son and daughter-in-law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They brought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the ""BEST"" chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like. I am a (chipaholic) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip.

I was a little skeptical, at first, since I was trying to figure out how they were made if they weren't baked or fried, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them.  This variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite(s).  If you're a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips, this are a must-try.",food
1752,"I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.<br /><br />The best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  I hate rice hates but loved these (just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor)and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.<br /><br />I recommend giving these a chance, they are a great healthy and quick snack.",food

When I first tried them, I could tell right away they were different from the greasy, salty, fatty chips I was used to eating.  These have their own flavor and crunch and I started to appreciate them right away.  I noticed I didn't feel so sluggish and icky after eating these.  Which was wonderful.  The combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty.  And I love the smaller packages.  They really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging.",food

1775,I originally found these at a Target out of my home town. I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher's plan. They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty. I could not find them where I live so I purchased them from the Pop Chips web site which took me through Amazon. Yummy!,food

I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.<br /><br />If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy/salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them. My husband loves them, my co-workers love them, kids love them. They can not believe their Mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day!<br /><br />Overall an excellent product !",food

1782,"I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.<br /><br />Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.<br /><br />It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)",food
1783,These chips are incredible! Enough can't be said about them. They are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories!,food

1785,"Love these pop-chips! The variety bag was a great deal, especially with the $5 off.  Tasty, low fat- just what I needed as a healthy alternative for a great price. I highly recommend these!",food
1786,"I love Popchips!! They taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Popchips several months ago and I have not looked at regular chips the same.  I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.  Make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats, because as I stated before they are quite salty. I highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative.",food
1787,Love All THE FLAVORS!!!!! JUST THE RIGHT SIZE PACKAGE AND TASTE GREAT!!!!! GIVE THEM A TRY YOU WILL LOVE THEM ALSO!!!!!,food
1788,"I discovered Pop Chips a year or so ago, and my whole family LOVES them!  We are partial to crunchy, salty snacks (like potato chips) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload.  These are a perfect substitute!  Great to tide you over between meals, or with a sandwich, or a movie-watching snack.  The small size bags are perfect for NOT getting too carried away, too!",food
1789,"I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it.",food
1790,"I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured ""what the heck!"". WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!!",food
1791,"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better.",food
1792,"I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!!",food
1793,"I shared these with my two older sons, then ordered more. These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work.",food
1794,"I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure I'll get them again.",food
1795,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!"".",food
1796,Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Can't be returned.,food
1797,in my book. You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections. The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet.,food
1798,OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some...<br /><br /> I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHO'S!<br /><br /> Just not for me!,food
1799,"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her.",food
1800,they taste awesome! esp the salt n pepper one! I love them and they are really healthy! the packaging is really good..,food
1801,"These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips.",food
1802,"We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!",food
1803,"Popchips are an excellent snack. I really like all of the varieties. I use Amazon's subscription plan and save some $$  -  I get 1 24-pack box per month, shipped automatically. Life is grand!",food
1804,"Popchips are phenomenal!  Unfortunately, just not readily available at a retailer near you.  Ordering online is the next best, especially with Amazon Prime service! My dad loved his boxes of Popchips.  I'm happy, as his daughter, to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep.",food
1805,"I am enjoying the recent purchase of PopChips, so far I have enjoyed all the flavor choices.  The individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if I have a craving for a snack.  Thanks for the product. Jean Roth",food
1806,"I'm really glad Amazon carries these, they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too.  We haven't found a flavor we didn't like yet.  I'll probably use the Amazon subscribe feature to get another $3 off as we will go through these fairly regularly.  Awesome chips!",food
1807,these are the best chips I have every tasted They are Healthy for4 you & have Great flavor  I will buy often I eat 1 bag a day with my Lunch  Yummy !!!,food
1808,This chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover.  All the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt.,food
1809,Great Chips - No after taste...<br />Seem to be much better for me.<br />Need to buy the big bags now.,food
1810,"I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea!  I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!  If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors!",food
1811,"Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat ""regular"" ones. Won't buy again.",food
1812,"Amazing concept... not fried, not even baked... Popped like Popcorn... !!!!<br />This is another product for my Weight Watchers regima. Each bag is only 2 points.. I love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch. They taste really good.. my favorite are the Bar-b-que, Salt & Vinegar, and the Sour Cream.. they are all good though.",food
1813,"Although they are mildly healthier, they don't taste as good as Baked Lays.<br /><br />Also, having a huge box of chips around isn't necessarily healthy because I ended up eating them more often.<br /><br />They are worth a try, but they just seem a bit overpriced (even with subscription savings) and over-hyped.",food
1814,"They're okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.<br /><br />~ The Good ~<br />Good flavor, no too strong or weak.<br />Crunchy, but not too dry.<br />Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.<br />Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.<br />All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.<br /><br />~ The Bad ~<br />Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.<br />Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.<br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br />I'm 50/50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.",food
1815,"I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.",food
1816,I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.,food
1817,"I ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and I'm so glad I did.<br />All of the flavors are tasty and satisfying. At 100 calories a bag, they are a great snack. They quell that hunger for crunchy, salty, goodness without killing my diet. Yes, they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips, but it stops me from eating just a couple more and 1 bag is really enough to keep me happy. I've got a new favorite chip.",food
1818,"If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more.",food
1819,Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco. An 18 pack is only $7.89 at Costco.,food
1820,"So for a ""healthier"" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt.",food
1821,"I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being ""healthy"" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well.",food
1822,I HAPPENED UPON THIS ITEM IN MY LOCAL DELI AND BEING CURIOS I DECIDED TO TRY.  THEY WERE FABULOUS BETTER THAN THE REGULAR CHIPS BY FAR.  I GIVES YOU SATISFACTION OF CRUNCH AND FLAVOR IN A POTATOE CHIP.  GREAT GREAT FIND.,food
1823,"I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!",food
1824,The chips are good with fast service but I ordered a case(24) of Popchips 6-flavor Variety Pack and received 24 bags all Barbecue flavored.,food
1825,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )",food

1827,"I first tried the BBQ flavor at a restaurant, which was good. Then, I was carried away with the 1/2 fat part, which made me pay without realizing my mistake!<br /><br />The ""Salt & Pepper"" is OK! ONLY OK, after trying another one, I changed my mind!<br /><br />The ""BBQ"" is good, but not that good!<br /><br />The rest is pure trash! I did not like them, what-so-ever nor my other 4 friends!<br /><br />The price is wayyyyyy high, and not worth it for a small single serving, as others such as Utz is WAYYYY better and cheaper!<br /><br />3 starts is too much for this over-marketed, less of flavor, and over-priced snack!<br /><br />AVOID!<br /><br />2 stars off: bad flavors<br /><br />1 star off: PRICY AS SH**!, and not worth it!",food
1828,"I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to ""pop"". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one ""T"", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped...",food
1829,"The flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper? Tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar, thee two varieties just make one go yummm EWWWWWW tossed out those verities but the others were very good. Less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor. Still a good item but I wouldn't suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with.",food
1830,"The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi-grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood.",food
1831,I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.,food

When I received them I checked the ingredients, and they contain ""yeast extract,"" which is synonymous with MSG (yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid).  I will never purchase this product again.",food

The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money.",food
1836,"These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.<br />Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores.",food
1837,"I'm not as crazed about these as everyone else, but for a low-calorie snack, they're fine.  They certainly don't do much to curb the appetite though. I'm typically just as hungry after finishing as before - not like with Protein Chips (also available through Amazon).",food
1838,"The texture is like rice crackers, which I personally don't like. Taste isn't too bad, but every single bags are too salty, even the original flavor. I'd give four stars if they make low sodium chips. The salt.. is one of your worst enemies. I bet it does more harms to your body than MSG's.",food

The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.

1846,"I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.",food
1847,"Wow, these are remarkably tasty chips.  I discovered them through Weight Watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat.<br />But they are high in flavor and umami.<br />I am now a big fan!",food
1848,"These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.<br /><br />The ""Original"" style taste exactly like Munchos, but don't come with the high calorie count.  The other flavors (Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Salt & Pepper, Cheddar, and BBQ) are all delicious, as well.",food
1849,"We liked these.  Quite good, even if they're 'healthy' @ 100 calories & 3 whole fat grams a bag. My favorites are the plain, the others are very strong flavored, very zippy!",food
1850,"I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases, shipping is free! Get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through!<br /><br />All of the flavors are really good.  I even liked the BBQ which I normally do not like in a chip. The cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt'n'pepper have a kick. They do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fat/calorie chips.",food
1851,"Love these chips.  They are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all.  There is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped.  The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag, but there are lots of chips in the bag so it's a great snack.  The ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added.  Fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq.",food
1852,"I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!",food
1853,"I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.",food
1854,"These are the greatest potato snack products I've found.  Only 2 points for Weight Watchers.  Really crispy and tasty.  All of the flavors are great.  My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors, but I guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it's a great trade off.  I would recommend these chips to everyone.",food
1855,"I really like these chips.  They have a different texture than regular potato chips but I still find it really tasty.  Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things ""healthy"" and ""low fat"" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people.",food
1856,"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.",food
1857,"Wow, these chips are delicious!<br /><br />They're low in calorie and carb count. I can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil-smothered grocery store chips.<br /><br />The sour cream & onion, salt & vinegar, and cheddar are my favorites!<br /><br />If you're weight conscience, want something healthy, or just want something that tastes good, buy these chips! You won't be disappointed!",food
1858,"This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.<br />Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.<br />These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.<br />I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.<br />I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.<br />All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.<br /><br />The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!",food
1859,"Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated.",food
1860,"It felt weird ordering 24 bags of chips off the internet that I had never even tried before, but I am SO GLAD I DID. They are delicious! I've tried 4 flavors so far & have loved each one. These are a win. :)",food
1861,I actually purchased these. I myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring. From the reviews I thought they was more like munchos. They are not. BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips-,food
1862,We have these suto delivered.  They are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size.  Great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors.,food
1863,These are my favorite chips! The BBQ and Salt & Pepper are the best!<br /><br />The texture of these things ROCK!<br /><br />All nicely packaged.<br /><br />Gluten free if you care. I don't but some have commented on that.,food
1864,These chips are tasty and low in calorie.  If you are gluten free they are a great option as a to-go snack.  We love them.,food
1865,The product arrived quickly. All bags and chips were in place...and safe ;-D These chips are delicious and only four WW points!,food
1866,"I like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that I can munch on with my lunch. I love the flavors and the packaging is perfect. Worth the buy!  The price is right, the flavors are just what they want, portion size is good thus it's a win, win situation for me and them.",food
1867,"Overall the chips were very tastey. My pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me. Some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations. Try it and see for yourelf, Enjoy.",food
1868,"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as ""regular"" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!",food
1869,"I ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal. This size bag is perfect for snacking. The assortment of chips is great, there's something in there for everyone.",food
1870,Love pop chips! The assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties I  wanted. Did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great!,food
1871,"I really like the pop chips, but I do not like all the flavors. The only ones I like are the originals.  The rest of these flavors were really not good.  At least not in my family.  I gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them.  Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.<br /><br />This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.<br /><br />I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others.",food
1872,"Delicious, light and full of flavor. It's difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is, but BBQ is amazing! I was impressed with the packaging, but I can't imagine it is too cost efficient or eco-friendly. That is my only complaint. Great product and guilt-free snacking.",food
1873,"Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ, Original, Salt & Vinegar and Sour cream & onion chips are superb!",food
1874,"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!",food
1875,"Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)<br /><br />Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.<br /><br />Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low salt<br /><br />I will not be buying these again.",food
1876,"I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!",food
1877,"I loved this product, and it was better than what I thought it was going to be. My favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor (yum yum) but I hated the cheddar, and salt & pepper ones.",food
1878,"I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.<br /><br />I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.<br /><br />If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker.",food
1879,"+Really really tasty<br />+Much healthier than almost every other potato chip<br />+A variety of flavors, consider this a huge sampler<br /><br />-Sea Salt & Vinegar is crazy sour.

1884,"I won them off a penny auction site. My 2 year old likes them plenty. I don't think there is any potato flavor, they taste more like ricecakes to me, but are ok. The salt and vinegar is strong holy cow!!",food
1885,"These chips arrived in terrible condition. The box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. Why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. The box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??",food
1886,Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste.,food
1887,"I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack.",food
1888,"I was looking for a quality, low points (Weight Watchers (WW)), crunchy, salty snack.  I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a ""popped"" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life-long fan. ...until something better comes along.",food

1890,"The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I won't be buying this again for lunches although the size/packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., weren't really kid-friendly).",food
1891,"Got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store. This was a great buy. Thanks, Amazon!",food
1892,"These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.",food
1893,I have subscribed these chips. They are so tasty. Not dry or oily. Cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.,food
1894,"I love these chips. They are so delicious, it is so hard to eat just one bag. All the flavors allow you to taste them all.  My favorite flavor is the cheese ones. Go ahead and try them.  They are so delicious.",food
1895,"I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well, they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldn't get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of ""burnt"" flavor wasn't there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers.",food
1896,"I found these chips originally at a local market.  However, I have been unable to find them since.  WHEW!  what a relief when I was able to locate them.  These chips have so much flavor, they're not greasy and they are crunchy.  I am a chip-a-holic and these are by far the best chips I have ever eaten.",food
1897,"These chips are great. Delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips. I have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious. I found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. All the flavors were to my liking. The only con about this is that THEY ARE ADDICTING!!!. You are warned! I purchased these through Amazon.",food
1898,"these are the best chips ever. I will buy them again, wish more stores had them.The plain chips are my fav.",food
1899,"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories.",food
1900,"I'm sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highly-palatable junk food. Junk food is delicious but it ain't good for you. Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.<br /><br />I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.<br /><br />For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.<br /><br />If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.",food
1901,"I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.<br />I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted.",food
1902,"This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.<br /><br />Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.<br /><br />The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order.",food
1903,"Yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! I am not a big health food person, I'll take the grease if it makes it taste better. These are 100x better than those baked chips. My brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked I mail him while deployed. Only draw back to these chips, they are definitely not for dipping.",food
1904,"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag",food

I'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot...not so much. If you eat mildly hot foods this shouldn't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. I didn't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor. I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. Overall I hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :)! Love!",food

One day I picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week I had about 4 empty bags in my Trash cans. Office snack a must! Unfortunately this product is too good to last and I fear it will meet the same fate as Wasabi Funyuns.

However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot).",food

Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.",food

When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.<br />I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.<br />All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.<br /><br />3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.

1918,"The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out. I keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side).",food

1920,"I rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this!",food
1921,"I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches.",food
1922,I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!,food
1923,"Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half).",food
1924,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!",food
1925,"I wanted very much to like this product, but after using it for more than 9 months, I just can't. The clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. It's also difficult to get the cover on, especially when you're trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. The o-ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesn't seem to seat correctly. After removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, I've never again been able to get it to be water-tight. Consequently, every time I use my pod,I have to store it in a bowl or else I'm mopping up water from my fridge shelf. On the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day!",food
1926,"My wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism I gave it a try. It seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the ""seal the deal"" moment was when I put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where I mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later (we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation) I opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. I doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy $10 to justify.<br /><br />It's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods.",food
1927,"I bought one of these about 4 or 5 months ago - and I LOVE it!  I have kept a combination of Rosemary, Thyme and parsley.  They have all kept fresh for more than 4 WEEKS!  No brown spots, no rotten leaves - just perfect.<br /><br />I Highly recommend this product - no problems with leaks or the plug not holding.",food
1928,"I am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about 4 months ago. I am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time. It not only gives more options when I am cooking by having fresh herbs available, but also, its easy to clean, and stores easily in my small fridge. I really think this is a must have product for EVERYONE!<br /><br />And if interested in a larger one, I attached a link to the company site (Prepara), where you can see all their cool and innovative products.<br /><br />[...]",food

Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better.",food
1930,"I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldn't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldn't get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height.",food

1932,"The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question.",food
1933,"I got this in my Christmas stocking from my stepfather.  We're both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.  I love this product.  I use this one for scallions/green onions which until recently always went bad before I could use all of them.  Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad.",food
1934,"After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response.",food
1935,After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!,food

The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work, so that I can have a fruit snack easily even if I was too busy or forgot to bring lunch.  So far I haven't gotten a can that had any problems.  The watermelon isn't crunchy - of course not! - but it's good, and certainly not ""slimy"".",food

Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.

I usually buy 4 of the 25oz. bottles and that'll last me several months. Shipping is pricey but the bottles come not only packed in peanuts but also bubble wrapped.

I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds.

They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.

If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.<br /><br />Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Don't microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo!",food
1991,I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.<br /><br />I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5/8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full-size Belgian waffle maker.<br /><br />Easy to make and very tasty.,food
1992,Nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by Stonewall kitchen.  My mom complained about the price but I think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake/waffle mix.  The waffle comes out golden and crispy.  I was using the Presto 03510 FlipSide Waffle Maker.,food
1993,"I have been making Belgian waffles using the Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix for over three years.  My waffles are undoubtedly the best ever!!!  I like my waffles light and crisp - I can't stand a heavy soggy waffle. These just melt in your mouth.  I have made homemade waffles, but I have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix.",food
1994,This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you don't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven.,food
1995,"I have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work.  So you have to add an egg & a little butter!  It is well worth it.  I am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime.  They are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My family loves, loves them.  The only thing different I do is instead of the extra 2 tbsp of water they call for, I add 2 tbsp of vanilla in place of. Best waffle mix!!",food
1996,"I had read some favorable reviews of this pancake mix on Amazon quite a while ago.  I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the ""just add water"" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. I have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... Highly recommended...",food
1997,"I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, it's not great. I believe my waffles made from Bisquick were just as tasty as these, and this costs quite a bit more. The instructions ARE very easy to follow though, and I DO like the canister for storage.",food
1998,"I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them.",food
1999,"What can i say??  They are wonderful, and the highlight of each weekend.  OHHHhhh  - use soda water for the liquid !  even better !!!",food
1700,Crowded. One main seating area mainly lounge seats with some cafe tables next to the bar but also separate areas to watch TV. Very limited selection of food although could purchase some cafe style meals. Complimentary vouchers (2/person) for drinks. There is a small children's room with electronic games and computer. Bathrooms located only at one end of lounge which seems a long way from TV areas. Only 2 computers were available on the evening we flew (other 2 out of action) which seems inadequate for such a busy lounge.,lounge
1701,Never in many years of travel have I experienced such a bad First Class lounge. Was there mid- morning no food selection to speak of just cereals. Plenty of champagne though. Tiny area with not enough seats for the 4-5 flights that leave around 11am. Received a very late boarding call resulting in us holding up the plane as it was ready to leave. Compared to most Qantas lounges in the world this was disgraceful. Qantas need to re-think how they treat their platinum members especially considering that this lounge also caters for the EVA air flight and JAL.,lounge
1702,I was an Air New Zealand Business Class ticket holder and I was surprised the plane did not depart from T1 like most Star Alliance flights but discovered ANZ code share with JAL hence T2. Anyway I arrived from T1 on the inter terminal shuttle and asked at the transfer desk which lounge I could use and I was directed to the Qantas business lounge. I had a shower and used the internet stations. The choice of food was okay - nothing specatular. For a 30 minute use the lounge did the job well.,lounge
1703,"Scandinavian Airlines lounge at Stockholm Arlanda Airport is ok but at a lower standard than the average Star Alliance lounges at to other airport lounges within the Europe. The lounge is well situated if you have a departure from gate 1-10 otherwise not. The lounge can at some times during the day be very overcrowded. The variation of drinks is good but the food served has not been changed for many years and there is no variation to the menu. The food and snacks offered is often ""healthy and sound"" but gives the impression that it is composed based on guidelines from the Swedish Government Health Ministry. This is a modern and sound lounge but this makes unfortunately the longe a bit boring and too ""Scandinavian perfect"".",lounge
1704,The SAS lounge at Copenhagen Airport is well situated and has plenty of seats and is seldom overcrowded. The variation of drinks is good and the food served is good and is relatively often altered. The food is to my opinion the best of all SAS lounges but does still not fully match the food served at fellow Star Alliance member Lufthansa at its hubs at FRA MUC and DUS. The atmospere in the SAS lounge is however very nice with a typical Danish touch that to my opinion could be even further developed for the benefit of the experience.,lounge
1705,"This SAS lounge is very often overcrowded. The variation of both food and drinks is very limited. The lounge is frequently visited by Swedish politicians and civil servants from the Swedish public administration representing the Swedish Government. This may be one of the reasons for the poor and very restricted offering since Swedish government employees is normally not allowed to drink or eat during business trips if not on their own expenses. I guess that SAS as still partially government owned have considered the above fact an adjusted this lounge to be ""political correct"".",lounge
1706,I have written before extolling the virtues of this lounge and there are none better. Have just finished a delicious breakfast of eggs benedict with smoked trout two of the best lattes I have ever tasted and fresh OJ. The staff here are warm friendly and helpful. It is the best way to start a 14 hour flight to the US.,lounge
1707,To be honest the QF domestic Business class lounge is not much different from the QF Club. Aside from fewer people and prettier light fittings almost everything else is the same. The so-called Neil Perry signature food selection amounts to little more than a plate full of fancy party pies. The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean. Also noted that the tiles in the male toilets had been stripped off revealing the besa-brick construction (very attractive!).,lounge
1708,Qantas use the JAL Business class lounge at SFO as they do not have their own. As there are no JAL flights departing concurrently with the Qantas flight it is exclusively used by Qantas passengers. The lounge is designed with Japanese passengers in mind seats are small and lined in a row not in way that allows groups to sit and face each other. There are a limited range of snacks but plenty to choose from in the fridge. Bathrooms are clean but no shower facilities. Wifi is the standard T-mobile paid service.,lounge
1709,Very limited food no international newspapers (only scrap leftovers) slow Wifi Star Alliance Gold customers are blocked from SAS Fast Lane - stay away from SAS lounge and CPH airport!,lounge
1710,I have given SAS a lot of stick over the years. But credit where credit is due. The lounge in Copenhagen is slightly refurbished. Very homy and nordic design. Certain parts like the bathroom and shower facilities are stuck in a less modern state. They have quiet areas. The bar is not stocked with a lot of wines and liquer. The bar offers 2-3 red and white wines soft drinks and water coffee etc. The food is mostly the same. The staff is helpful in regards to boarding passes changing flights and other assistance.,lounge
1711,"Really enjoy the SAS lounge in Copenhagen airport - especially now when it have been partly refurbished. Cosy and ""homy"" atmosphere love the fireplace and new seats simple - but good - food (seems to have been updated) service minded staff. Good place to be - like Copenhagen airportt in general.",lounge
1712,I think this is the case where the hype is better than the reality. Whilst the Qantas First Class lounge in Sydney is very nice with its openness and design the lack of attention to detail lets it down. The first impression upon entering the main lounge - a dirty floor going up the escalator to the top floor. Toilets - not only was the floor filthy beyond belief but two out of the four toilet stalls were either not flushed or had excrement in them. When I informed reception of this they told me that they just had a lot of flights leaving. Is this suppose to be an excuse? If they knew this then someone should have been right on it. Nearly half of the computers did not work. One had a virus warning flashing on the screen! The restaurant had an excellent selection of food which was tasty and made to order. The wine selection was the best I have seen. Also the spa centre was brilliant! I had the best face and neck massage that I can recall. Although my wife was less impressed with her manicure. Overall this is a very good lounge but is let down by a lack of attention to detail.,lounge
1713,Friendly and enthusiastic staff good service clean and well maintained and plenty of space. Good food choices - all in all a sense of really being appreciated.,lounge
1714,Mostly I visit the lounge between 0630-0730. During 5 years the breakfast has been the same no surprise or thrill. Lounge is old and worn and would be better with refurbishing. Staff is okay not too fast to clean empties away but okay. You get a nice welcome and when passing the front desk. For later flights the food (especially lunch) could be improved a lot. Getting tired of Cold smoked lax and salad/spinach. But drink selection is perfect.,lounge
1715,The lounge has a relatively nice design and atmosphere but it was cramped with people and hard to find any seats. The food is more or less always the same some kind of salmon salad and cream cheese -very limited variation and range. Staff friendly but not as service-minded as SAS cabin crew.,lounge
1716,I frequently visit SAS Scandinavian Airlines lounge at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport Terminal 5. The atmosphere in the lounge is relatively relaxing but the lounge is normally far too occupied and there has been no improvement for several years in that aspect. The meal service is very limited and is normally made up of some variant of salmon with cheese creme. The breakfast has never changed during the last 5-10 years but is better than the food served during the rest of the day. Some more ideas would be mostly welcomed. The variety of soft drinks wines and spirits are ok. There are plenty of newspapers and magazines and very easy access to Internet via wi-fi.,lounge
1717,Very small accommodation for 18 passengers which is the maximum per A310. The lounge is small when two or more simultaneous flights. We found it unattended and receptionists not too concerned with the well-being of passengers. The lounge is equipped with a tiny bar and refrigerator was padlocked. No special service as far as access to the aircraft. In a scale 0-10 I give them a 1 on the account that at least the door was opened.,lounge
1718,What a surprise compared to the hideous Admirals Club in Terminal 4. Hot meals (chilli con carne chicken stir fry etc with rice and noodles) choice of 3 beers good red and white wines and spirits bar. Plenty of PC's to catch up with emails courteous attentive staff. Great shower rooms although the water outlets need replacement. Plenty of space in a quiet relaxing environment. Can get a little crowded when 2 hours from 4 flights departing. Overall especially in terms of lounges in the US very good.,lounge
1719,The ambience is active but quiet. From the telephone call the day before asking us what time we would be arriving so the kurbside porter could help us with our luggage to the boarding of the plane all needs were met. My partner was wished a Happy Birthday from every staff member who met us at check in at the Lounge entrance and after our meal in the Lounge restaurant where my partner was presented with a small birthday platter of fruit. All this occurred by a mere mention of the event during my telephone conversation the day before.,lounge
1720,Used this lounge while flying back to Canada via Copenhagen and Frankfurt. Attractive spacious good supply of magazines and newspapers. Ample snacks and drink choices. A comfortable spot to while away some time before boarding.,lounge
1721,Standard SAS Business Class lounge. Comfortable but nothing special. No other choices at this airport for Star Alliance passengers.,lounge
1722,This lounge is immaculately maintained - as was stated previously can become somewhat irritating as they will pounce on a finished glass of drink or cleared plate - can't really complain though. The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find. But it handles to steady flow of numbers very well and never feels full despite the time of day.,lounge
1723,The staff were attentive and friendly. As there is no airside pharmacy in Sydney international a staff member actually took my script had it filled at a pharmacy in another part of the airport had it cleared by security and delivered to my table. Now that's service! The menu is the restaurant is short sharp simple and of excellent quality. The facilities are great I like that you can choose to use either Mac or PC in this lounge. They have a very nice day spa hard to get into but when you do very much worth the effort. The bathrooms are not that great but you really are not there to spend too much time in there. It's wonderfully spacious with plenty of places to sit. The only annoying factor was the number of children in the lounge. All in all a great place. This lounge is the only reason that I will continue to use Qantas it's a great benefit for platinum frequent flyers- Qantas inflight service could learn a lot from this lounge.,lounge
1724,Very clean spacious lounge split between two floors. Good selection of cold food - salad cold meats cheese bread coleslaw etc. Extensive selection of wines beer spirits soft drinks. The washrooms are clean. There is a variety of seating designs - bar-style sofa areas dining tables quiet rooms and television rooms. Very clean airy impressive.,lounge
1725,SAS Business Lounge on Terminal 5 is a small but efficient Lounge but the place is in need of remodeling - its very worn out and in need of a facelift. Other than that its a standard kind of lounge with polite staff the snacks are pretty good sadly they don't offer shower cabins!,lounge
1726,Sydney business lounge very spacious with nice views. Food quality good hot food offering of soup and meat pies a little disappointing but cold meats cheese were of a high standard and bread was fresh. Lounge feels too modern could do with some nice artwork to enliven the space. Nice light fixtures particularly at the large communal style wine bar. Plenty of room to relax and find privacy if needed. Nice mix of seating arrangements. Nice showers. Overall a pleasant pre flight experience.,lounge
1727,The renovated Qantas Club at Perth International is a vast improvement over the old one. It's looks and feels like the other Mark Newson designed Qantas lounges with the seemingly larger space punctuated with different areas serving different purposes. The toilet and shower facilities are also much improved while the food and drink on offer has not changed since the old days. The only major gripe would be the extremely warm temperature of the lounge which was acknowledged by the receptionist as being problematic.,lounge
1728,Thought the lounge was excellent in a functional way - not luxurious. Typical Scandinavian decor and lighting - clean and bright. Plenty of computers (Macs). I was there at breakfast time and they had a good selection of food drink newspapers and magazines. It was a bit full apparently they have another seating area upstairs. Bathrooms just so-so would have expected tip top cleanliness but no. Staff impersonal.,lounge
1729,There are two SAS lounges at Oslo Airport; one for business class and one for Star Alliance gold card holders (Scandinavian lounge). Both lounges are nice but the Scandinavian lounge has a more exclusive feel. Food selection is not overwhelming but it's high quality Scandinavian healthy food. Great work stations views of the airport / gates average but professional staff.,lounge
1730,I do not know why the SAS staff act like in the old monopoly times food downright disappointing the staff need a training in service and kindness.,lounge
1731,I use this lounge regularly and quite enjoy it. It is relatively centrally located or at least easy to reach through fast-track calm and spacious. The staff are relaxed and friendly. Newspaper selection good but sometimes worn out in the evening. The drinks selection is very good with one exception - seems very difficult to get an ordinary glass of water carbonated or non-carbonated. The food is simple but substantial and one can have a healthy snack or small meal. There is a section with good views - this is however let down by the constant blare of a TV with CNN.,lounge
1732,Quite nicely designed but very poor selection of food reading materials and drinks. Overall very dull with no real flair.,lounge
1733,A bit hard to find but well worth it. Quiet seating areas - booths tables and lounges. Wide variety of food and snacks. Short stroll to SAS gate. Would have liked some written instructions for the wireless internet access.,lounge
1734,Nice and comfortable place with a very relaxing atmosphere (lounge was nearly empty). Food variety is limited but this is usually healthy and fresh stuff. Good choice of drinks and newspapers. Washroom facilities are very limited. Free wireless internet or PC stations.,lounge
1735,SAS shares lounge with Asiana at SeaTac and the lounge is quite small about the size of an average family's rec room. Bizarrely there are no phones with local service available in the lounge. All phones in the F/J class lounge are pay phones and require a credit card to swipe first to make local calls. I complained to the lounge hostess and it appeared that I was the only passenger to ever have complained about not being able to make a local call without charge from the lounge. United's RCC at SEA has free local phones and I believe that is standard at most RCC facilities. The SAS lounge at SEA is also quite warm.,lounge
1736,I was greeted by a friendly staff. There was a very tasty and extensive western and mid-eastern food selection and many hot and cold beverages. Beef tenderloin was dry. Frequent table bussing. There was free WiFi that worked fine. Air conditioning was comfortable as was seating. I would enjoy another four hour layover there.,lounge
1737,Simply disappointing. I was really frustrated by the computer facility and the internet connection. After having a look at the food presented I simply grabbed a coffee and cake from the Cinnabon Cafe opposite the lounge. It just looked so dull.,lounge
1738,The lounges in Dammam are horrible and it would rank it the worst I have ever seen. I do not understand why Skyteam is not setting minimum standards for business class lounges as the Saudia lounges have no international standard as far as I am concerned.,lounge
1739,Very poor. Has the basics but very little. Screens telling you of departure times and gates are in Arabic then 5 seconds in English. Even if it was in English it would be pointless because they put your gate up about 10 mins before it opens then everyone runs and form a massive queue from the front. I waited for 45 mins in a queue because flight was delayed and they never opened gate. When I got to the front they said that it was for a different flight and then I had to go to the back of another queue. Disgrace is too good a word for this airport. I have travelled here on and off maybe 5 times in past 18 months and still the same.,lounge
1740,"We used Scoot in Style with our booking. That allowed us entry to the SATS Lounge in Changi Terminal 2. It is shown on the barcode of your boarding pass and that is scanned at entry. The lounge is quite big and well worth the cost. Plenty of drinks, alcoholic (whiskey, wine, gin, vodka) and soft. The coffee is delicious.. Everything is self serve, so you can eat as much as you like. Best was the beef stew, nice and tender. Staff were cleaning all the time and topping things up. For a 2 -3 hour stop, you could easily recoup value for the cost. ",lounge
1741,A light and airy lounge and very spacious. A good selection of work stations lounge chairs and dining arrangements. Wine beer and non-alcholic drinks were available but they had completely run out of glasses and were using paper cups. The food was mediocre - just a small selection of sandwiches and some noodles. Overall it was comfortable and pleasant but not outstanding.,lounge
1742,An okay lounge compared to Air China facility at this airport. Have to go up to top floor in lift and most irritating aspect was the smell of cigarette smoke - despite this lounge being non smoking. A fair selection of Chinese style food is provided and limited choice of drinks. Staff very nice and friendly but cannot speak much English. Internet service was not that good and the choice of newspapers is of course rather limited. A pleasant alternative to the main terminal waiting areas.,lounge
1743,We used Sichuan airlines domestic first class lounge in Beijing this April. The lounge is small in size and could seat 50 passengers. It offers a small selection of snacks a coffee machine beer and soft drinks. The lounge is long and has sofas one side and 3 VIP rooms on the other. The staff speak good English and were helpful. The one let down was no english news papers or english TV but i was in china and not my own country. Overall i would recommend using Sichuan airlines domestic first the lounge was clean and comfortable and the price was right.,lounge
1744,Le Anfore handling agent lounge. Worst lounge I have been in. Very little food. What there is is stale. Staff are okay but not very happy nor helpful. Dirty toilets. Men's toilet did not even have a seat!,lounge
1745,"I was flying Turkish Airlines and as a Star Alliance Gold member I had a choice of a number of lounges. I tried the United Airlines lounge first as I heard some positive reviews. However also decided to try the Singapore Airlines lounge. I arrived at around 10.15am. As well as the expected English breakfast buffet, I was glad to see Chicken Sambal on offer. It was really excellent: chicken on the bone (or rather falling off the bone) and I added rice, hard boiled egg and chilli - I really really enjoyed it. I accompanied my brunch with a glass of champagne. The decor was very agreeable, lots of brown leather seating and a good view of the apron. The lounge is not as big at the UA lounge and it does not offer as much natural light. But the decor and food offering makes it a better lounge for me.",lounge
1746,The Kris Flyer Gold Lounge in Singapore is miserable. The food hasn't changed for a long time and I am flying SIA regularly. No showers no rest areas.  A shame for a top airline.,lounge
1747,Huge lounge with a great selection of food and ample drinks. Superb showers that were cleaned after every use by the attendant and I was even whisked into the first class shower units as there was a queue and 'they didn't want me to have to wait'. Only downside is the lack of nap cabins or a quiet area for a long stop over. Internet was a bit hit/miss very difficult to connect to but worked well when it finally connected.,lounge
1748,Very spacious lounge. The individual desk carrels in the back are extremely comfortable and ideal for work. Staff were quite nice. Food was less than mediocre. Biggest drawback is that lounge is a giant den with no windows so mobile reception was iffy at times.,lounge
1749,"The lounge is one floor down from the departure gates and there are no signs to guide passengers specifically to the the Silverkris Lounge (in contrast to SIA's competitors). Follow the sign that reads: ""Other lounges"". The premises appear tired and worn with what looks like 1980s decor. This lounge is definitely in need of refurbishment. The bright white neon lights lend it a cafeteria feel. Food and beverage offerings were limited by SIA standards.",lounge
1750,Good variety of drinks. Decent selection of food choices. Chairs not exactly the most comfortable. Big negative is no toilets but it appears from other reviews that this is an issue with other lounges in this airport.,lounge
1751,They treat Star Alliance Gold Members as the lower class. Food is not nice no showers not comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this lounge to no one. Airport is nice but Gold Lounge is not comfortable at all.,lounge
1752,A very comfortable if not undersized lounge for the demand placed by the mid-afternoon volume of FFs and Premium passengers on the A380. Food choice was 'good' at best however with the volumes of food offered on board the plane the selection of tasty cold bites and a few hot dishes was more than enough. Staff were exceptional and the hostesses circulated the masses and offered Champagne refills without prompt - a nice touch. The lounge is relatively well appointed but there was no spare seating capacity and I can anticipate this becoming an issue if other Star Alliance FFs flock there given the airlines reputation for high standards in its lounges.,lounge
1753,If you are expecting an experience comparable to the very good services provided by the silver kris lounge in a Singapore you will get a shock. This is a cramped unattractive space with limited facilities that does not compare well with Singapore Airlines overall business class product.,lounge
1754,The Port Lounge is a relatively small lounge in Kolkata airport but the food choices weren't bad (Chinese and Indian veg and non-veg including rice fish and other items); you could have a full meal. The alcohol selection is not huge but sufficient. There is a limit on the number of drinks per guest but no one was enforcing such a limit (if it exists). The lounge is clean but it has no view.,lounge
1755,"We were flying out on Silk air so my normal Star Alliance entrance wasn't applicable. So we used our priority pass card. The lounge was horrible. Stained furniture carpets exposed cables etc. The small amount of food there was looked like it had been there for days. No alcoholic beverages. The whole place looked like a 1950 soviet style lounge. Needless to say we left after 5 minutes. Then they had the nerve to charge my card $34 for each of us even though we should have a free visit! Do not go near Singapore priority pass lounges. I would give them ""zero"" stars for most choices.",lounge
1756,Very average. Every time I am here there seems to be a good gossip session going on among the staff loud and given it is not a self serve bar totally absent when it comes to offering a drink or being at the bar when one is looking for a drink. Much prefer the London lounge a business class lounge close by. Food looks like it has been sitting out forever and again staff don't approach to offer anything from the menu. A shame as Singapore Airlines in flight service is terrific.,lounge
1757,Being the HQ large clean lounge. No sleeping rooms like in FC lounge. Bathroom with showers excellent.,lounge
1758,Visited the Singapore Airlines T3 lounge at London Heathrow as a passenger with Thai Airways en route to BKK. Star Alliance lounge share. As always lounge was peaceful. Good flow of fresh foods with staff preparing more pastries when they ran short. A much better option than using the London Lounge suggested by Thai as that is a shared First and Business lounge.,lounge
1759,New lounge fit-out looks sleek. I travel through Sydney a lot and it was desperate for an upgrade. Staff are friendly. Food really average buffet was cold and tasteless. I would have thought they would have really stepped up a notch with the new look. Unfortunately don't expect to much on the food front.,lounge
1760,Lounge is a bit small and in need of revamp. Had internet and plenty of drinks. Food was great and just what we needed. lots of interesting and tasty things on the menu. staff was friendly enough. Seemed fairly busy though.,lounge
1761,Visited on 26th December their new revamped lounge. Everything okay and considering they spent some money doing it up they did not really put any effort into the food side. What was on offer was cold meat pie cold grilled sausages curries that were lukewarm (beef rendang that did not even look like the real thing) Chinese congee that had very few condiments and a few other dishes of similar temperature. All served buffet style and obviously as time went by the food becomes less appetizing. Considering they have the Australian consulting chef Matt Moran on SIA's culinary panel why did they not use his talents to come up with something more original like gourmet appetizers rather than the same old tired food formulas. What a disappointment they did not think out of the box in the food department. I wonder why SIA does not win any awards as offering the best airport lounges?,lounge
1762,"Adelaide Airport - we always make a point of arriving early at any airport and taking time then to relax (approx 2-21/2 hours) but Customs (international gates) at this airport do not open until 90 minutes prior to the international flight so we were unable to access the small Singapore Airlines lounge downstairs. We had assumed that as Virgin are Singapore Airlines ""partner"" airlines we could use their lounge. Definite not. The customer service lady only granted us access to the Virgin lounge because it was empty we have a Bronze Card and were over 60. Compare that to the excellent Qantas lounge that we had used in the past!",lounge
1763,The seating is ok and the decor is simple. This is definitely not the newest lounge and has very little atmosphere. Drink options are unimaginative and not impressive. The only real upside I have to say is that the food is quite good (not many options) - definitely better than the Economy class fare onboard so I always tend to eat my meal in the lounge. WiFi works but is not super fast. The lounge is kept quite tidy by the staff.,lounge
1764,The lounge is far too crowded facilities dated and insufficient even for a 747 never mind an A380. Food selection limited to a couple of noodles and a few wilting sandwiches. As for the champagne don't start me on that. Even to wifi was intermittent. The lounge is not disabled friendly with an elevator which has no sides or back to the moving parts.,lounge
1765,Different from the better Changi Airport's Krisflyer Elite Gold/Silverkris lounges this one in London is a little bit dirty with some leftovers stains on the carpet more limited choices of drinks no proper meal offered only some tiny tasteless sandwiches and crisps. It's also a lot smaller and much more noisy compared to those in Singapore.,lounge
1766,Travelling back to Auckland from Heathrow and after a tedious journey to the airport and then the bun fight getting through check- in and immigration etc we were looking forward to getting in to the Business class lounge to relax and refresh ourselves before the long flight. No chance the lounge was small crowded hot and rundown. The food was minimal consisting of packets of cheese a few biscuits some miserable looking sandwiches and the odd piece if tired fruit fruit. What a let down for a 5 Star airline. Extremely disappointing. Changi was better and so it should be as it is presumably their showplace lounge but not fabulous.,lounge
1767,Lounge was a bit dated however food was great. fantastic variety and very fresh. However did run a little low on portions once it became a bit crowded. Loved the Asian curry.,lounge
1768,This lounge has no toilet - let alone a shower! It was also very warm. Having got off a long flight from Sydney I was most unhappy. The whole idea of flying business and having access to these lounges is to have an advantage over the rest of the travelers. Not having a toilet and shower is ridiculous! The lounge pleasant enough and service very good but food ordinary.,lounge
1769,Used their Changi Airport lounge before heading to Sydney. Facility design is impressive but that's about all this lounge offers. Food are in substandard condition and beverages just as limited as the onboard offering. Too many people about and unsure if it was because I entered during peak times but it felt really cramped. Some tables still had leftover plates and drinks making it look shabby. This lounge does not have bathroom facilities and was told to walk couple hundred metres out of the lounge which I found incomprehensible. Lounge staff pretty much non existent other than at the reception area where they were rude and disgruntled. Very poor lounge to relax in and not worth lugging your bags into.,lounge
1770,"Silver Kris lounge in T3 - it is a beautiful room ruined by despicable customer service. There were at least five staff in the front desk and not one smiled or made anyone feel welcomed. I watch in astonishment when ""elite"" passengers were treated like passengers on a bus in a third world country. I don't know if anyone from Singapore airlines will see or read this but the staff on duty on the night of the 1st of May 2013 should really be reviewed especially a short haired Eurasian looking lady. Wished I caught her name but really Singapore airlines needs to lift their game here. When travellers are spending copious amount of money to fly with you make us feel at least welcomed? Silver Kris lounge in T2 - I left T3 because of the overall lack of respect to customers. But what I found in T2 was the direct opposite. This is where everything came good. Staff were so polite and helpful. Goes to show that it does not matter how much you spend on perfecting facilities when you don't have the right people.",lounge
1771,The lounge in Adelaide is quite small with no windows but it is only for Singapore Airlines passengers so it didn't really feel all that crowded despite being small. One major advantage is that unlike all of the other lounges it is after immigration and security checks so once you reach the lounge you can just relax. The food and beverage selection is small but sufficient and the toilets (there are 2) are clean.,lounge
1772,Overall a clean and comfortable lounge (both in Terminal 2 and Terminal 3) with a good selection of food. There are no boarding announcements however so make sure to check your ticket for boarding times.,lounge
1773,Lounge is large and comfortable with a nice view of airport. Wifi is working well. Food choice is good and ranges from salads to hot soup chicken as warm pasta and more. Drinks are served at the bar by the glass for booze and wine. Soft drinks and beers are served in cans. Not much reading material but a decent lounge to relax before a long flight.,lounge
1774,As a gold frequent flyer I was looking forward to relaxing in a lounge on the way back to Australia flying with Singapore Airlines. Given that Singapore Airlines is based at Changi I had high expectations of the lounge quality. However I was directed to the gold lounge that was very disappointing indeed. No service cramped seating flat beer mangy sandwiches and no toilet! I think that Virgin should look for a better code share partner if this is the standard Singapore Airlines have to offer.,lounge
1775,"This lounge was by the far the worst we have ever experienced. It was shabby the staff were rude or just grunted. There were only two toilets one of which was out of order and this was not even clean. The noise level with dishes being clanged and banged at the bar area was unbelievable. SIA need to engage in some serious conversations with Roma airport as the advertising states that ""the Le Anfore Business Class Lounge offers a haven of peace from Rome Fiumicino Airport. Treat yourself to the VIP lifestyle!"" - well it doesn't!",lounge
1776,No hot water in showers. Waiter who was laying out food dropped cutlery on floor and then without cleaning it put it on table for guests to use.,lounge
1777,Pleasant welcome. Had the lounge all to myself - early Sunday morning. Good selection of snacks and drinks. Spacious - comfortable and varied seating with views of the airport runway.,lounge
1778,Large lounge overlooking the tarmac. Lots of different zones to sit in but it got really crowded with Start Alliance and SAA flights using this facility. The mini wraps and sandwiches are acceptable but you have to ask for bottled water and chips and the attendant had a bit of an attitude. The internet was very good and the shower facilities good.,lounge
1779,Very average lounge. Chairs reasonably comfortable but no loungers. No toilets or showers in the lounge. Toilets down very quiet corridor which is worrying late at night. Good food and reasonable selection of drinks. Staff not particularly on the ball.,lounge
1780,One of the worst lounges I have ever been in. The staff were totally disinterested the food was stale and minimal and the lounge area very small with tacky furniture. Avoid this lounge its a lousy excuse for a lounge. I hope Priority Pass takes notice and stops ripping off customers in this way. Its totally not worth it.,lounge
1781,Very good lounge - lots of food on offer though the selection did not change during my 8 hour stay. The seating was comfy and offering good privacy. The staff were very helpful and even when I walked in and out of the lounge regularly they did not raise a fuss and ask for a boarding pass. The toilets were clean with great showers that were well stocked. The wi-fi was easy to access.,lounge
1782,Refreshing clean well staffed and friendly. Didn't mind spending time here waiting for my flight. Staff were very friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome on arrival and departure. What you would expect from a business class lounge.,lounge
1783,The layout itself is not very appealing and the food selection is quite basic. I don't take pre flight drinks but the choice I noticed was very limited and the access poor.,lounge
1784,A large comfortable lounge with good amenities (including smoking room TV room children's room and showers). A nice selection of packaged sandwiches and wraps and a bar with a good range of alcoholic beverages as well as a proper espresso machine. Staff were friendly and pleasant.,lounge
1785,It was really disappointing to access SQ Gold Lounge at Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. No shower facilities available in either lounges. It mainly affects Gold member who transit in Singapore. Gold members are not allowed to access business lounge Singapore gold members do not usually need shower facilities at departure only these poor transit Gold members. It is a big disappointment. After a long flight a shower could make huge difference. Food and drink were limited you don't want to drink a lot anyway because there is no toilet inside the lounge. You have to go outside and bring all your belongings and come back again. So it is another strategy to encourage you drink less and move on quickly. It is really not a lot of point to build up your SQ points you get less and less for benefit.,lounge
1786,Lounge is small with very limited food and drink on offer. Not up to the standard of other carrier lounges in Sydney. The restrooms are also very small. I left to eat some overpriced airport food.,lounge
1787,SilverKris business class lounge at Changi airport is quite spacious with excellent choice of food offerings. The bar had a good choice of wines and non alcoholic drinks. Good wifi although had a couple of attempts at logging in. Staff service only mediocre as they did not bother to see who was there and kept pestering everybody in the lounge (a total of less than 10 passengers) more than once about missing passengers on some SIA flights. The place was rather claustrophobic without windows and did not have the general airy feeling that was usual at Changi. For a short layover I would just go to the lounge for the food and drinks but exit to enjoy the excellent airport that Changi is.,lounge
1788,"Checked in at 10am en route to JNB and Hong Kong. On arrival at the lounge counter staff were chatting among themselves - not really interested; no verbal communication from them - even after our ""hi"" - just a pointed arm in the correct direction after we accidentally turned toward the first class lounge. The lounge itself is light and spacious. Enough choices of food and some fresh fruit. Surprisingly no decaf coffee - not an uncommon demand these days. Upon leaving we again had no acknowledgement - the ladies did not even glance at us as they chatted. A simple smile with a ""hello and welcome"" and an ""enjoy your flight"" as we left would have sufficed. It left us wondering if the rest of our flight was going to be like this - thankfully it wasn't. Johannesburg Business lounge (on our return) could give them a few tips.",lounge
1789,Great new lounge SAA has in place now from the World Cup. Large and comfortable. Free wifi smoking room good views on tarmac food good expresso machine run by staff instead of just self serve. Overall great new installation in the airlines home airport.,lounge
1790,Very large lounge with plenty of sofa style dining recliner seating. Seperate kids area smoking zone TV zone work stations etc. The bar is manned and decent selection of drinks. Food selection is average for J class lounge. No hot food just sandwiches fruit and salads. Excellent showers and bathroom facilities. The staff felt too much at home and were loud and obtrusive. Excellent view over the aprons. Free WiFi. Overall great lounge.,lounge
1791,Sitting here at 1500 hours wondering what happened to SIA's famed food/hospitality. There is one member of staff for the whole lounge serving drinks topping up food (more later) clearing tables etc. The sum total of hot food available is a tureen of lukewarm leek and potato soup. That's it unless you like the one variety of sandwich available or scone and cream or microwave noodles. As for access it's a slog up the stairs or a ride in the service lift. Paint peeling off the radiator in the Gent's loos. Truly low grade compared with their rivals. I had more choice free of charge on the train coming down - bacon sandwiches scrambled egg and smoked salmon for example.,lounge
1792,Excellent lounge in Singapore with plenty of room. Good food and wines on offer. Only available for Business passengers on C class tickets not to Star Alliance Gold card holders. Krisflyer Gold card holders in economy must use the lounge next door. Seems a bit off to not allow a larger lounge and have *G use the facilities. I understand that the First Class lounge is currently being renovated and therefore F pax are also using this lounge.,lounge
1793,Even as a solitaire member you don't get access to the first class lounge. The business class lounge is really busy on a Thursday evening waiting for the Singapore flight people had to stand. There is rubbish on the tables that does not seem to get cleared for hours. I don't know how much SIA pay for using this but it's too much.,lounge
1794,SAA have an arrivals lounge just after you clear customs before exiting into the arrivals lounge. It is well marked to the left and upstairs. It is not large but has 4 excellent showers good selection of food (breakfast was cereal toast pastries sandwiches fruit tea/coffee etc.) No alcoholic beverages. Smoking room. Comfortable seating. Again the staff are too loud and obtrusive but provide good service. Free WiFi.,lounge
1795,I thought the lounge was excellent. I thought the staff were great and facilities good also. Its no Singapore Airlines but its fine for price paid for ticket.,lounge
1796,As we were flying first on Emirates we had access to the South African Airways lounge. First class passengers were directed to the right and business class pax to the left. The lounge is not really big but it has all one needs except wifi. There are 2 computers but the connection is really slow. There is a nice coffee corner with snacks and some alcohol aswell as a smokers lounge. The nicest feature however were the showers: really big clean and with lots of amenities.,lounge
1797,There is still a lack of shower facilities at both T3 and the newer T2 lounges for Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold Members (SATS lounge at T2 is no longer made available to SIA KFGold Members). As the toilet facilities are located just next to the lounges additional plumbing costs and showers fittings would be at a bare minimum to sat the least - a real disappointment when a shower during transit will be a refreshing welcome between two long haul flights. Singapore Airlines are dropping their standards across the board. A real pity for a once premium carrier.,lounge
1798,"T3 Business Class Lounge - as usual the staff at the front desk grimaced at all the guests walking in. I was there during breakfast time and the food was dry overcooked. Would have been helpful if they had some fresh fruits - even some apples and bananas on a plate would be helpful. I had a quick bite walked out of the lounge with the customer service staff staring at me. I walk no more than 10 steps out of the lounge turn to go back in as I left my jacket and was stopped at the entrance with a very brusque demanding ""Boarding Pass please"". Well at least she said please but honestly? If I did not live in Singapore I would never choose to take SQ as my first choice. Customer service is appalling unless you're a well dressed business man.",lounge
1799,This lounge is disappointing and perhaps a reflection of how SIA views Star Alliance Gold fliers from other airlines - ie. poorly. The food service area is small with a limited selection of light meals. There are no toilets or showers in this lounge. So it is not a great place for a transit stop. In comparison the SATS lounge in T2 is a better lounge.,lounge
1800,Pathetic is the only word I can use to describe this lounge. I asked at the first class lounge why we were not allowed in there (facilities fabulous for first class). After complaining about the lack of warning for business class passengers about the lounge they would still not budge saying that we are unable to use the facilities besides the toilets which were located in the first class lounge (none in the business class lounge and quite far away!). Very disappointing. Like other reviewers it is unacceptable that SAA expect business class passengers to pay the full price but do not provide the full facilities.,lounge
1801,Very poor. At approximately 10am it was impossible to find a seat. Selection of food and drink minimal. No wireless and only two computers. No toilets. No telephones.,lounge
1802,I prefer the old brown leather seats in the T2 lounge in Singapore - far more comfortable than the newer seats in the T3 lounge - especially if you have a longish layover. I see they are going to renovate the T2 lounge - I hope that they retain the old leather lounge chairs. I hope if they ever renovate the Sydney lounge that the keep the older brown leather chairs.,lounge
1803,I would expect a lot more form Singapore Airlines. Sydney airport lounge is appalling considering the levels of service Singapore claim to offer their passengers. with 4 flights per day from Sydney - and at present two of these are A380 services. The size of the lounge the seating food and beverages all very average. I was very disappointed.,lounge
1804,"Since my last review of this renovated lounge a year ago, improvement has been made. Staff are welcoming and courteous. Depending on the time of the day you visit, food plentiful and delicious. This is a lounge which offers good food, not just finger food or snacks, but a full dinner or lunch. They have a bar with wine, beers and other drinks. A quiet section for passengers who wish to catch a moment of rest. Wifi is free. Bathrooms and showers well maintained and staffed. The lounge has a great view of the runway.  It is for the use of business class passengers, and I believe maybe Oneworld emerald members too (not sure). Oneworld gold members use the Palm strip lounge. One complaint, the air-conditioning which is always too cold in there. ",lounge
1805,A bit of a journey to find this. Every drink ordered had to be matched to invitation card which was a bit of a farce as they did not keep them in any order. Whilst the decor wasn't special the food and snacks on offer were very tasty. Restrooms nothing special.,lounge
1806,The ultimate horror lounge. I was there during peak hour at 11pm. It was so crowded that most had to eat/drink standing. Drink and food choice was reasonable but the size does not match the demand.,lounge
1807,Outstanding SIA Business Class Lounge in T3 with many separate sitting areas including one for catching a nap on a sofa. Staff gave me a blanket and pillow and noted my seat number to ensure I didn't miss my flight! Wine and liquor selection somewhat limited. Food selection was excellent with prompt removal of used plates and filling empty food trays. The shower stalls aren't as good as a few competitors but other facilities in the restroom area are very good.,lounge
1808,"Quite a few airlines use this lounge, but when we were there, lunch time, weekday, it was nearly empty. There were plenty different drinks to choose from. Serve yourself. Food was snack type, but eat as much as you want. A pleasant way to spend an hour or so whilst waiting for your flight.
",lounge
1809,Small but quiet. Good selection of refreshments & drinks. Ayurveda massages offered. Wifi was complicated to access but the staff logged on my smart-phone for me. Pleasant staff service always with a smile.,lounge
1810,Used this lounge on 15th February 2014. It has recently been refurbished and is spacious and has plenty of seating available. Food on offer at the time of our visit 2200 to 00.30 was good with a choice of hot of cold meals. One good thing is that the hot meals are presented in small amounts so that they are kept fresh. Service was good and there was choice of drinks with champagne on unlimited supply if you wanted it. The only thing I found lacking was that there were no peanuts on offer. Toilet facilities are good and clean but I did not notice any shower facilities. Overall a vast improvement over the lounge used last year.,lounge
1811,Very quiet and beautifully lit made for a very relaxing wait. the dining and food was great the bathrooms in the first class lounge were stocked full of great toiletries and fluffy towels. overall quite impressive I thought especially after the dreadful 1st class lounge that they use in Terminal 1 at Dubai airport.,lounge
1812,A small but well appointed lounge. Plenty of individual body hugging armchairs. A small but very tasty selection of foods including dim sum gourmet sandwiches cold meats yoghurt maggie beer ice cream nespresso coffee machine spirits and soft drinks. Bathrooms clean and well maintained. Staff very friendly and attentive. Free internet and wifi access. Great selection of newspapers and magazines.,lounge
1813,Compared to other SQ lounges I have used this was very disappointing. Very small - was awaiting SQ220 departure an A380 with a full Business Class cabin so there were few empty seats. Decided to leave and used the adjacent NZ lounge. Many times bigger better food selection and facilities.,lounge
1814,I tried this newly renovated lounge at the same location of the previous one. It's very cold with excessive air conditioning. Staff greeted me warmly lounge offers good view of the runway and has a bar as well. Also some comfortable lounge chairs at the back if you want to relax and take a nap. A few computers were available for use to check emails etc. Free wifi in the lounge. However some problems in the toilet/shower it's showing signs of age despite it being a few months old. Strangely so many attendants inside the toilet (hunting for tips?). Door knob of a disabled toilet came off as I was closing the door also some wood chipped and cracked in the door! The luggage storage area is a joke it's stacked full of their junks wheel chairs and work papers. They still have miles to go before making this lounge a great one.,lounge
1815,You get what you pay for. We found a cheap business class ticket to Europe on Sri Lankan and are now in CMB for an 8 hr layover. We left the airport and have eaten at Negambo beach (which is worth it if you're wondering just a 15 min taxi ride away) and are now back in the lounge. Vinyl tub chairs a la 1989 (and no it's not meant to be retro) small toilet area (staff will wait outside cubicle until you are finished) one shower and pretty average food. A nice chill out zone but it's small. Oneworld level of service/quality this lounge is not! All in all cheap airfare means this is what you get so I am grateful to be flying business on a bed and I guess lucky to be in a lounge.,lounge
1816,UL uses the Dnata lounge in SIN terminal 3. The lounge is small and overlooks a void into the main terminal so squealing kids from below can be heard loud and clear. Food is OK drinks basic but plentiful staff very warms and welcoming good showers and bathrooms.,lounge
1817,Spacious lounge with clustered seating. Very quiet. Had a good selection of hot and cold dishes and an array of beverages including champagne! Chic look but missed recliner cushy sofas! The washrooms and showers were very clean and attended to! Vast array of newspaper and reading material. Could do with a spa to go with the cool look and good service! The biggest miss was the view of the tarmac!,lounge
1818,"One of the best lounges I have ever used. Very calm and relaxed ambience. Lots of high quality seating available. Great food and drink selection. Free wifi. Server was down at first but after pointing out the problems I was having logging on manager at the business centre made few calls and had the server re-booted. Empty dishes and tables cleaned frequently. Shower and restroom facilities spotless. Lounge would be perfect if they had a separate ""rest area"" with lounge chairs and mobile phone restrictions.",lounge
1819,There are two minor problems with this lounge: the lack of windows - in common with most of the international lounges at MEL - and the fact that like most of the Silver Kris lounges it is looking a bit dowdy and dated. The amount of space was ok food and drink selection was fairly good and the lounge was very clean.,lounge
1820,Serendib lounge was quite difficult to identify though the facilities were pretty good. Lounge was clean with good food and beverages & WiFi with decent speed. A 15 minute complimentary massage is wonderful. Staff quite courteous and helpful. Washroom was mediocre. Overall I rate it slightly above average.,lounge
1821,I was quite impressed with the clean and spacious Serendib lounge. We arrived very early in the morning so there weren't many other people around but even as other passengers trickled in it still didn't feel crowded. However there are only a few toilets and an attendant in there all of the time so it can feel a little cramped in the bathrooms. I liked the view airside and we were able to get seats right near the window (one of the advantages of arriving early I suppose). The food and beverage selection (especially the tea) was good. The staff make boarding announcements and will come around and tell you individually when your flight is boarding.,lounge
1822,I agree with the other comments on here about the lack of toilets and showers - completely disgraceful. The lack of lockers for hand luggage is also irritating for a solo traveller as every time you want to get a drink or some food you have to haul all your things with you and potentially loose your seat. Having said that I found the service and atmosphere to be adequate and lounge felt relatively spacious. The food and drinks were fairly plentiful but a bit stodgy.,lounge
1823,The lounge is spacious and comfortable and was occupied by another passenger and myself flying on SQ to Singapore. We were informed that free massages were available but unfortunately there was no one available. There was a good selection of Eastern and Western food available for breakfast with a good selection of Sri Lanka tea as well. Toilets were extremely clean with an attendant checking it after each use. Great view of the east side apron and partial view of the runway. Good customer service with SQ ground staff accompanying you to the airbridge.,lounge
1824,We didn't really like this lounge much as it was noisy crowded and some of the staff seemed a bit surly - though one of the staff clearing away plates and glasses was very friendly and we chatted with him for a while to pass the time. I think the best seats are near the windows but they were all taken when we arrived so we ended up with some seats in the back corner near the computers. The food was okay not delicious though selection of drinks quite good. The bathrooms were clean. We ended up leaving the lounge early to wander around the airport as we got bored of sitting and staring at the wall.,lounge
1825,A good choice of foods at breakfast and meal time. There were a lot of staff working in the lounge. Front desk was not always occupied and had to wait several minutes on both visits. Staff were friendly and there was an extensive choice of drinks. Wifi and use of computers including a printer were very helpful. Lots of seats but no recliners which would have made the 4 hour wait more enjoyable. Shower facility very limited a shower is located with a toilet and there is only one shower - making it difficult to use as several people were waiting. There is also an indication of a rest room but if this was available it was never advertised. Unable to use lounge after departing flight and told to go to transfer desk to see about getting accommodation even though it states on some literature that you can use the lounge after departing the plane to freshen up. Even though we were transiting passengers and using Business for all flights we were told we could not use the lounge unless it was less than 12 hours before departure.,lounge
1826,Definitely dated and was the smallest business/first class lounge I have used. We were there for breakfast just before our flight. Food selection was narrow. The toilets do need upgrading. Another inherent weakness is that they do not offer to look after your handluggage/trolleys whereas in the MAS Golden Lounge you are granted the use of lockers. We were told this was for security concerns; if this was so then MAS would also do the same.,lounge
1827,This expansive lounge with its phalanx of greeters the subdued blue-lit translucent columns at entry is as appealing as it is enormous. Huge number of seating options from pleasant views out to the departure gates to snug corners for a snooze. The usual CNN slash ESPN flat screen offerings. A large selection of food; unusual for what you’d expect in a Biz class lounge (SIA has a separate wing for First). About eight hot options some Chinese some Indian as well as dry snacks. Lots of beverage options although probably on purpose the liquor is in a bar area quite far away from the food offerings. There was good scotch Champagne and some OK bar drinks. The array of papers was astounding: All the European dailies plenty of English offerings including a Globe and Mail. The bathroom is large with plenty of showers and has Occitane products. In short our lounge experience far exceeded our flight experience.,lounge
1828,This was my first time in the SATS Star Gold Lounge at Singapore. It is big and has a reasonable selection of breakfast food (it was early am). The staff were very efficient and the lounge kept very clean. Not sure if WiFi was available but the lounge did have at least 2 commuter stations with web access. Unbelievably there are no toilets in the lounge. You have to go outside and use a public toilet. There are no showers either in what is a major Star hub this is unforgivable.,lounge
1829,Good lounge with good selection of drinks and food Showers wifi and computers available. The lounge has a balcony overlooking main airport areas and this means it can be noisy. Well maintained and not many people using lounge.,lounge
1830,Nice large not too crowded lounge with decent food and drinks. Toilet and shower facilities not the best but a lot better than most European and US lounges.,lounge
1831,Agree totally with Mr Weiss (review 30 October). For a new home base lounge this is totally inadequate. At 8.30am it was impossible to find a private seat. For the one cooking station there was a queue - it really did not matter as there was no table space for one to sit down and eat anyway. I cannot imagine why in a brand new terminal this should happen.,lounge
1832,Generally a good lounge with good seating area mind you some lounge type seating would not go astray as we had a four hour layover and it would have been nice to stretch out. WiFi is good but at times very slow. Food okay but have seen better in other business lounges. Plenty of space and lots of seating so finding a good corner not a problem. The showers are especially welcoming and staff are very helpful. They should have a wider range of wine as they only had Reisling on offer. Generally not a bad lounge but I cannot understand why Singapore Airlines do not announce flight departures.,lounge
1833,Food quality was rather poor. Aircon was not turned on so it was quite warm. Plenty of space as it was not busy. Plenty of computers and free wifi. Free 10 minute massage with an extra 30 minutes costing $20. Shower and relaxing rooms available.,lounge
1834,Comfortable lounge with a good selection of local and western hot and cold food. Good selection of drinks including a cocktail of the month. Lounge and bathrooms clean. 6 quiet rooms in which to relax/sleep and the complimentary 15 minute massage - not to be missed! There is a dining area with a large TV and more relaxing area with coffee tables looking over the apron. There are six computers and also free wifi and the option to sign out an ipad for you stay in the lounge - also an option to use an Xbox in the lounge. I find the staff in this lounge most friendly and helpful of any; they even escort business passengers to their gate. The access seems quite strict and at times it can become crowded. It can be easy to miss; just at the top of the escalator in departures and to your left.,lounge
1835,Used twice recently and can't be faulted. Very relaxing with complimentary massage and good selection of local and western fare.,lounge
1836,Small and dated lounge but with a nice view of the gates and runways. Food selection so so. However the washrooms were old and not maintained. The public ones were much cleaner. Definitely not up to SIA standards.,lounge
1837,Disappointed in the fact that the lounge overlooks the departure gates and has no direct natural lighting. The atmosphere and decor are pleasant. The buffet with a chef preparing breakfast orders is nice but the restaurant seating area is clearly insufficient for the number of passengers. The same facility in the Business Class section appeared just as overtaxed. For smokers there is an outdoor terrace located immediately outside the lounge entrance.,lounge
1838,A great lounge which has strict entry control. Its been opened a while starting to look a little shabby. Good choice of food and drinks pleasant service. Shower facility a bit poor and cramped.,lounge
1839,Would have written about their lounge in Colombo but never could find it! However I can write about their lounge in KUL (KLIA). Rather than have a lounge of their own or sharing with one of the major airlines that have lounges there they send their business class to the horrible little lounge that anyone can buy a pass to. Crowded dirty a smoking area that can at best hold 5 people standing (and almost always packed) poor food. It was so bad that I went to the public area and paid for food and drink.,lounge
1840,Very comfortable and spacious overlooking the runways. Excellent choice of hot and cold food hot and cold drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic. Free massage showers and internet access. Good selection of international and local newspapers. All in all as nice a business class lounge as I have used.,lounge
1841,"The La Vallette Club seems to be the only airline lounge at Malta airport and it covers all types of traffic. From paid memberships, through business class pax for various airlines and also I believe for Star Alliance Gold and I guess One World Gold pax too. Though there was some confusion over guest access for a member which is plus one for *G everywhere, at least that I'm aware of. They were happy to let the card holder in but had to consult the rule book for a companion. This took a while but all was OK in the end. Perhaps it was because Swiss was new to this airport, but then they have had other Star Alliance carriers for a time now. The lounge itself is a decent size but it's on the basis side when it comes to food and beverages. The white wine was especially poor. But lots of nice leather lounges to sit on, free and fast Wi-Fi, active TV news monitors, windows albeit to the landside of the terminal and a business centre with desktop computers and a printer. The lounge has dedicated bathrooms and a shower. The lounge guys were very pleasant and it was an easy place to wait it for a few hours during our flight delay.",lounge
1842,This lounge is apparently a new one opened by SIA. There is a long trek to it - too much of walking actually. The reception staff are warm and just welcome you but do not give much information of the lounge. The worst part is that the lounge does not have any toilets or showers! Something really unacceptable for a newly opened lounge in such a spic and span airport. Hot and cold food items are present and internet access is also free. Overall a good lounge but marred totally buy lack of toilets and its distant location.,lounge
1843,Overall a decent lounge. Plenty of seating good access to TV and internet as needed. Selection of food and drink limited though of a good standard. No shower facilities observed. Unfortunately the level of service provided was substandard. Firstly the initial greeting at the reception desk was sullen mechanical and cold on both occasions I entered the lounge. Secondly there was no lounge manager visible to oversee the generally running of the lounge. This was evident by food bowls remaining empty for significant periods of time as well as floor staff (especially the male staff members) who simply loitered around the drinks areas and whose behaviour was unprofessional bearing on juvenile.,lounge
1844,I was impressed - staff were wonderful. I travel in and out of Bangkok often and will always use this lounge.,lounge
1845,3 hours of transit in Colombo with access to Serendib Lounge in CMB airport. The lounge access is not really clear no indication just a small label on white doors. Its spacious with modern stuff for a biz lounge : hot meal shower 6 internet access and massage service to de stress from your flight. You have 6 rooms to sleep. The only negative point is that shower were used by a staff member when I tried to get inside. For passengers holding a Skywards Gold card or Silver and travelling on Economy UL has built a small corner separated from the noisy airport with small garden barriers and awful furniture. The buffet of this economy lounge consists in sandwichies and cakes with free drinks. You have also 2 internet access.,lounge
1846,First impression: Two very unfriendly ladies at the reception. They refused to let me in as I had no invitation. I told them they I had checked in online but still: No. They sent me a transfer counter where they would issue me an invitation. But they said: No you can access lounge without invitation. So back to the lounge and finally without excuse they let me in. The lounge itself is dark no windows artificial lights dirty. The food supply is - how shall I call it - rather limited und looks disgusting. I only took a coke as it was in a sealed bottle. WLAN was okay. Very loud music was played. Restrooms outside the lounge. I left the that place rather quickly and spent the waiting time in the terminal. It must be one of the worst lounges I ever visited. Don't bother going there - shame on Swiss to offer such a hole to its passengers.,lounge
1847,"Apparently Swiss shares the Lufthansa lounge at Boston MA Logan International Airport. At least this was the case on May 21st 2015. I arrived at 5pm to wait four hours for a connecting flight to Europe. There appeared to be a decent assortment of alcoholic beverages a starchy soup hours d'oeuves of ""finger foods some cut up cheeses. I was glad I was not too hungry! Furniture consisted of small tables and chairs and nonreclining plastic-covered ""armchairs."" It was the least comfortable Business Class lounge I've ever visited. There's nowhere in this small two-room place to put your head back and relax.",lounge
1848,Long queues to enter lack of seating food selection terrible angry personnel - unfortunately it's been like this for several years and reflects Swiss Airlines approach to customer service.,lounge
1849,Small and basic lounge. Wouldn't have fitted everyone if business class cabin was full. Decor dated and showing its age. Very limited range of food available (possibly due to early morning departure). Too few bathroom facilities for lounge.,lounge
1850,Always much too crowded impossible to find seats. Selection of foods poor; low quality and hardly any choice. Selection of drinks okay but minimalist. Staff unfriendly. View is nice.,lounge
1851,Visited this lounge on Jan 4th at midday - the only food available were several dried up croissants as apparently being Christmas they had a problem with supplies! Unacceptable.,lounge
1852,Food offer not good - how about a simple healthy build-your-own salad. It wouldn't cost more than the food offered. Or offer food brought from one of the restaurants downstairs. In order to get decent food I now need to stop working and get to the airport restaurants outside the lounge area and then check in again. Apart from that this is a good calm and clean lounge.,lounge
1853,Very unfriendly staff they hardly greet you and do not want to help you even if you have a medical problem. When asked they told me to go to the Swiss counter they would not help as it is not their job - being a Gold Star Alliance member for many years I must say this is unacceptable. I would expect some more support. The food is bad no choice and the few things they have are without any taste. The lounge is always too crowded so it is hard to find a seat and there is a lot of used glasses and dishes around the staff is not fast enough to clean and maintain the lounge in a good way.,lounge
1854,I used the lounge as an Avianca customer. I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swiss logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swiss evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swiss lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.,lounge
1855,We were flying on Lufthansa from Geneva to Frankfurt with an onward connection on Lufthansa in international business class to Dallas/Ft. Worth and were able to use the Swiss business class lounge. We arrived at the door to the lounge at 5:20am only to find it was closed. However the hours of operation were posted and the lounge opened at 5:30am. Once inside we found a clean and spacious facility that was virtually empty of passengers as it was a Saturday. Given the hour we passed on the rather well stocked bar featuring a number of different alcoholic beverages (beer wine and hard liquor but no champagne) and opted for coffee orange juice and croissant instead. The food offerings were a bit limited; however we knew we were on a breakfast flight in business class to Frankfurt so no problem. There was also a good selection of newspapers and magazines. However there was no washroom located inside the lounge. All in all this was a very nice lounge.,lounge
1856,Very disappointing lounge experience: old and outdated lounge old design with dark colours (very seventies style) not very comfortable seats. Food choice and quality far below average. Also wine selection and quality offered very bad. Service not very attentive. Very surprising as usually Singapore and other major Asian cities offers good quality but this lounge in Changi Terminal 2 is clearly a disappointment!,lounge
1857,Absolutely underwhelming. 2 hot foods which are mediocre and a few salads during meal times plus 2 sandwiches which are the best of the offerings which says it all. Drinks selection is acceptable but nothing more. Very crowded you won't get seats in the rush hours. Toilets are too small too showers are ok but not really nice (Arrival Lounge is very good in comparison). Internet needs a code which you can get by text service or at the reception.,lounge
1858,For Swiss minimalism read scowling staff one choice of pasta soup straight out of a packet and that's it. Swiss lounges are probably the most basic I have visited with virtually no selection of food or drinks and staff who seen incapable of smiling.,lounge
1859,Very basic lounge no bubbles ready packed sandwiches limited alcoholic beverages. Old and tired decor. Needs a total revamp and not a pleasant experience. Staff could not be bothered. WiFi access intermittent.,lounge
1860,"I've been to this lounge twice in 2 months. Although large spacious and well lit it falls short of everything else. After flying in from Newark I requested to have a shower and was told abruptly that I have to wait. When I mentioned to the lady at the desk that the staff did not refill the shower & body lotion she gave no response. The food offered in this lounge can hardly be described as edible. The main course for lunch today is macaroni and potatoes! Pale yellow and totally unappetizing. Very little else is on offer. And they don't do "" smiles"" either. A little later when I enquire with the same lady if they had a day room she almost rolled her eyes! Swiss has failed badly in their effort to provide a Business Class lounge that could warrant any star rating.",lounge
1861,"This lounge was refurbished about 4 years ago when it became Senator lounge. The staff is far from being helpful and you do not feel welcome at all. The selection of food and drink has been the same from the re-opening. I will never understand that no food available from 10am - 1230 pm and from 1500-1730 h. Only hard dry sweets peanuts and that's it. The selection of newspapers downgraded each month. Waiters are very noisy joking ans shouting in the kitchen. Hot meal also the same for ages; rice with curry rigatoni with spinach pasta with corn. I always think of how they advertise themselves: ""Swiss hospitality"". Where are all those chocolates cheese and other delicious food from Switzerland?",lounge
1862,Swiss should be ashamed of their flagship lounge. First of all the location is a bit weird specially for those traveling international. The lounge is accessed after security but before immigration so you need to leave well in advance if your gate is in the E area. Staff are not welcoming and the bar staff are surly and rude and find it cumbersome to make a drink for you. Food is limited with 1 rice and some cold unappetizing sandwiches. Sadly enough of none of the cheese or chocolates which this beautiful country is famous for are seen in the lounge.,lounge
1863,Small lounge with limited food and drinks and by far the unfriendliest attendants from any lounges I've experienced. This lounge has only got one shower be prepared for really long wait for a shower. Luckily I do have few hours between the flights. When I asked about wi fi the answer was 'it is all written here'. Why work in service industry if you can't be bothered to provide service!,lounge
1864,Swiss provides lounge service for all Star Alliance carriers at JFK T4. Its probably the skimpiest lounge I have ever encountered anywhere. Catering in the morning is limited to some berries and some stale bagels. The cappuccino button on the coffee machine is disabled (saving milk?). There are no newspapers. The only thing there is are armchairs at least 10 years old and uncomfortable. I mostly use the lounge before the Avianca flight to Bogota in the morning and I thought that Avianca is the poor cousin in the Star Alliance and its passengers get correspondingly offhanded treatment. Not so. A couple of months ago I took Swiss First to Zurich and used the F section of the lounge. Indistinguishable except for a simmering pot of unidentifiable meat and half a bottle of champagne. Isn't Swiss service supposed to be something special?,lounge
1865,In transit and we first stopped in at Swiss Lounge D. nice comfortable facility but only one shower available. As we had a long layover the agent recommended we head over to the Arrivals Lounge just past customs. Clean classy and functional. The showers were a great size with clothes pressing relaxation zone and good breakfast variety. You feel more than refreshed leaving here. The one annoying thing is that the internet is limited to 60 minutes free.,lounge
1866,Out of 8 lounge visits in a two week trip this was one of the smartest ones we experienced. there are two showers that were more than spacious and well kept for use. The food choices were a hot buffet with 5 items (Thai Chicken curry stroganoff stir fry etc) and a full fridge of sandwiches sushi and fruit and yogurt as well as soup and self serve liquor coffee and drinks. Each zone allowed you to be private and work and the TVs were at a low volume so as not to disturb. The internet was a little slow and depending on where you sat would lose connectivity. Definitely worth seeking out and less crowded than the Bidvest and SAA Baobab Lounges that we also stopped in at.,lounge
1867,I am an occasional visitor of the Geneva SWISS Senator lounge and my Friday evening visit (25th January 2013) was my worst experience here. The lounge was very crowded and food trays were empty - the only food available was pretzels peanuts and candy. I waited for the lounge staff to replenish the food trays but they only brought out cake. Not this lounge's finest hour.,lounge
1868,This Star Alliance Lounge in LAX could be the worst First Class International Lounge in the US. First - it is ugly no life and for the next year no natural light due to airport construction. The seats are large but arranged in a train format - 2 by 2 and then 8 rows back. If you want to see the TV - almost impossible beyond row 3. Today - the seats were filthy - dry food on the first three seats that I sat on. The food is meagre and uninteresting. Some sushi - but overly cold and poor quality. Sandwiches are clearly made only once a day in the morning. Desserts not bad. The worst part is the staff - unpleasant and unresponsive at best. When I asked for the TV channels to be changed the front desk staff said that it would take 20 minutes - because that they needed a supervisor to do it. When I then asked one of the food clearing staff she changed the channels immediately. The staff at the desk tals so loudly that twice I had to ask them to quiet down so I could conduct a phone call on my mobile.,lounge
1869,High expectations on Senator Lounge on my first visit as Gold pax. Unfortunately in Zurich the Senator (Gold) Lounge has less space available then Business Class lounge at least at some hours. Walking around till someone leaves. Worse than 2nd class waiting rooms at train stations. In the meantime I learned to change to Business Class lounge (just more seats and more possibilities to find a quiet corner). Food about the same (extra sandwiches) and drinks also not too spectacular. Staff (waiters) the same as in Business lounge not very interested in the customer very loud speaking among each other and handling plates/glasses. A disappointment if you're hoping for a higher level of service.,lounge
1870,I had high expectations on this lounge and I can say my experience was not the best. I arrived around 7pm during a busy evening at Zurich Airport. Beautiful reception area and an elegant restaurant sided by a long bar which was almost full of passengers having dinner. Another room with large leather sofas sided by a buffet and bar. Windows with great views of aircraft. I opted for the buffet. Great choices of appetizers cheeses and breads all of high quality. Also great range of wines and spirits. Soon the lounge became crowded - used plates and glasses quickly filled the cocktail tables and buffet space. When I went to choose one of the hot entrees all of them had finished with no replacements. It is a well appointed lounge but service should be improved.,lounge
1871,The new Swiss arrivals lounge at Zurich is really excellent - particularly after a long-haul flight from Hong Kong. Located near the exit from Arrivals hall 2 (near customs) it has well-staffed showers (20!) that are very spacious and well-supplied and they also offer a 10 minute ironing service. The lounge area itself was large and at 6am-8am - the time I was there - the breakfast selection was excellent and regularly replenished. An ideal place to refresh while you wait for businesses or shops in Zurich to open!,lounge
1872,One of the several options open to Swiss passengers this one is located towards the north end of the main terminal on the upper level. Its clean and comfortable and peaceful. Good selection of drinks and during the morning a variety of breakfast food is available. Alas on the day I came back the only hot food provided was curry soup or Indian style rice (neither an option for me on my diet). Papers and magazines appear to be limited to german language editions although the FT was available in the afternoon.,lounge
1873,The new lounge in the recently opened Terminal B/D (non-Schengen) for flights to London etc. looks modern nice and has nice views of the tarmac but that is where the praise ends. Staff is typically LX being cold and not overly friendly. Food selection is a disgrace. One hot dish soup and bread with some fruits. Not really what one would expect from such a good airline. Drinks selection is ok and you get 2 hours of free WiFi with a voucher. Toilets are outside and the lounge is hidden in the far end of the corner. Staff in the kitchen is quite loud at times which means it is not that relaxing. There is also only one screen to check the status of your flight and it is not conveniently located. Swiss can do better than this.,lounge
1874,This is probably the best SWISS lounge (also doubles as Star Alliance Lounge). Amazing views of the runways from this circular lounge with surprisingly tasty hot food good selection of drinks and above all a very calm and relaxing atmosphere - even to the extent of having laid back chairs/beds to watch the planes take off and land. Free high speed WIFI. Worth choosing Basel to fly from if convenient compared to Geneva or Zurich just for the excellent lounge. SWISS do some things well (not all by a long stretch) - and this is definitely one of them!,lounge
1875,A brand new but typically Swiss lounge: cold staff no atmosphere very poor selection of food (rice apples and bread rolls) and a limited selection of drinks. Internet access is not free and costs a staggering 25 francs (20+ euros)! Very poor when compared to every other major airline.,lounge
1876,Staffed by moody unsmiling staff who fail to recognize that customer service is part of their job. The food choice is particularly poor - the usual cheese pasta (a staple in all Swiss lounges) and dried out sandwiches. Overcrowded and chaotic - on a par with Lufthansa.,lounge
1877,"TAM do not use Oneworld lounge at Frankfurt Airport since it operates on Lufthansa Terminal. In the past Senator and Business Class Lounges from Lufthansa were offered but it looks like the TAM Airlines need to cut down costs, so they have changed to Air Canada Lounge.",lounge
1878,I regularly use this lounge when transferring at Zurich. There is a good choice of seating. There are plenty of newspapers also foreign ones. Although a non-smoker the smokers' bar ie. the upstairs area with the serviced bar is my favourite spot. Best view nice light conditions very friendly bar staff and good choice of drinks. The choice of beverages in the self-service areas is very good. I love the Rivella a Swiss lemonade which is milk-acid based and very rejuvenating. The problems of this lounge are the lack of good food especially hot food items if any at all are very poor standard. Another problem are the loud service staff which sometimes make it hard to relax and refresh in this lounge.,lounge
1879,Very disappointing. The lady at reception was unsmiling and made you feel like you were keeping her from more important work. The lounge itself is adequate but it was entirely unacceptable that no hot food was available an hour before closing only old stale sandwiches. It's strange that the toilets are outside. The view was nice but the Swiss business lounge in terminal A is far better overall.,lounge
1880,Flew with TG and they use the Panorama lounge or Swiss lounge in Zurich. As we first wanted to use the Swiss lounge they told us that we can only use one lounge and if we used the Swiss lounge we could no longer use the Panorama lounge. I found this policy to be confusing and insulting if you have a business class ticket. So we decided to go to the Panorama lounge as it was closer to the gate but took around 25 minutes to get there first. Once in the lounge the food selection was ok and the drink selection was fine too. The views are magnificent and the lounge was not crowded even though TG SQ BA LX AC etc. all use this lounge. In comparison to other lounges worldwide it is average/below par. Internet is not free.,lounge
1881,Apart from its new location no effort has been made from previous locations regarding catering. The snacks quite often are stale with cheap cold cuts and poor quality cheeses. A mediocre service quite in tune with the TAM overall performance.,lounge
1882,The lounge is a dark affair without any natural light and deficient artificial lighting. Very poor layout in a meandering way. Food is very basic and drinks acceptable. WiFi was adequate with an access code. The lounge is used by several airlines and tends to get crowded. One of the poorer lounge experiences.,lounge
1883,In what is supposed to be the biggest airport in Latin America LATAM is providing a crowded place with poor seating availability miserable food offerings where dough seems to be the basic ingredient. Do not dare looking for plugs either. Better show up with a fully charged laptop.,lounge
1884,An awful experience. Staff not friendly. There were a miserable small plastic dishes on top of the bar with three pieces of sandwiches. The food selection doesn't exist. The drink selection is poor. Very old structure. Not recommended.,lounge
1885,Staff was friendly and efficient there were three computers with internet. Seating comfortable and spacious food selection good in comparison to other lounges. The drinks selection was very good.,lounge
1886,Tacky uncomfortable Lounge. Toy-town furniture. No privacy even from the corridors outside as some walls are only glass. Food judging by my numerous visits over the past few years is usually a bowl of tasteless puff pastry discs which often runs out before 5pm. Drinks reasonable. In short the lounge is almost completely neglected and permanently dirty. No information nor flights called as staff are too busy communicating with their friends. Toilets outside lounge. Wi-Fi sometimes sporadic and temperamental but always very slow. The airport should provide better both in quality of lounge and staff. Not under SWISS direct control of course but I feel they should insist on a better product than this.,lounge
1887,A very crowded place. Very warm. People sitting on the floor as no seats available. Left the lounge early to find somewhere to sit! Boarded plane early so we could sit down.,lounge
1888,Departing on Lufthansa First Class to Europe I visited the TAM lounges. The newly opened Business Class Lounge on Terminal 2. A big one with many sofas and family room computer stations self-service bar etc. It looked new and had views of the apron but I found it kind of tacky. Its buffet had a coffee machine plus petit-fours and cakes wines and other drinks. I asked the receptionist about the First Class lounge she said it was a 5 minutes walk to Terminal 1. So I moved and found it closed! I went to the opposite door the TAM Business Lounge and was invited to wait there as their First one would open soon. This is an older and smaller lounge it was very crowded and was even hard to find a place to sit. Noisy and dark but it was well-decorated. The buffet was ok with some wraps and wines/beers choices. Soon the receptionist came to me and said I could move to their First Class lounge. Small but decorated in good taste piano in the entrance leather sofas but no apron or outside views. The room looked exclusive and private. The menu had great choices as Lobsters Carpaccio salads etc. A great wines and spirits list.,lounge
1889,A disappointing lounge in one of the worst international airport terminals (Terminal 2 at GIG). Rubbery plastic-wrapped food small selection of drinks awfully slow complimentary wi-fi provided via a scratch card and limited to 2 hours. Furniture and decor are standard airport lounge fare. Bathroom had broken fixtures. The place is basically unstaffed.,lounge
1890,"Reasonable Lounge but not up to the standard of the Senator Lounge in ZRH. Pleasant and helpful desk staff. Service staff do not seem to want to replenish the stocks in a timely manner. Drinks but especially food run out quite often. Cleanliness does not seem to be top of the list either. White wine & Prosecco never kept cold. A dozen ice cubes will not do much for two or three bottles and cannot be expected to last for 2 hours! PC's now work since being replaced. Wi-Fi is available if a slightly complicated phone-back system is followed and the provider actually phones back. Lounge ambience is not too bad although not really relaxing as the lounge is usually quite full. Access is via an escalator up but only stairs back down to departure gates. Toilets are outside and quite a way from the lounge too far considering the Senator Lounge is supposed to be a ""prestige"" product.",lounge
1891,Ugly lounge with poor seating comfort poor internet services no good snacks or dishes. Even worse the personnel is very noisy (shouting laughing making lots of noise with empty glasses and bottles). Completely impossible to relax in that environment. Will definitely avoid ZRH for transfer in the future.,lounge
1892,Aesthetically pleasing bright lounge. Quiet good availability of computers amazing coffee machine good drinks selection. Main complaints is lack of food beyond peanuts and fruit and absence of bathrooms (you need to go outside).,lounge
1893,"Very clean and elegant but limited services. Wifi through a 3rd party company which gives you limited time (1 hour card). Nice selection of beverages but food in a ""canapé"" style.",lounge
1894,Lounge small and very busy people were sitting on the floor as there were no seats. Internet access good. Food dreadful. Limited quantity and what was available was awful. No cups or glasses available. Wine good but appears soft drinks were only limited to local brands perhaps due to the high volume of passengers in the lounge at any one time. Receptionist very pleasant but catering staff very sullen. I left very promptly after writing this review. Colleagues who have also passed through this lounge have had a similar experience.,lounge
1895,I quite enjoyed the lounge - only negative is that it can get overcrowded. But since my flight was a later one pax from other flights left early. I had a nice shower and enjoyed the toiletries. The food is in reasonable - tasty snacks and cakes. Drinks are good and wine is served if asked. Quite enjoyed the live music played by the pianist which always set a soothing mood. Internet is good and wi-fi password is given as you enter the lounge by receptionist.,lounge
1896,Food choice limited to one hot dish. Only one internet computer worked although there seemed about 5 or 6 available. Lounge clean staff unfriendly wash rooms needed cleaning as no clean towels for showers. Overall not up to First Class expectations.,lounge
1897,Very clean and well decorated. Welcome personnel is nice but limited to one. Internet stations work well and fast. Coffee machine is up to the state of the art. Alcohol drink choice is small. Snacks cheeses breakfast breads and croissants are plenty and healthy choices too. Fresh fruits also available. Only no hot choice is offer.,lounge
1898,Pathetic. Choice of a only a handful of drinks. Internet was not free credit card system in place. No food. Staff spent most of their time on loud bphone calls. Seats/tables not particularly clean. Toilets reasonable. SWISS should provide better.,lounge
1899,Small but nice place as long as it not crowded. Choice of newspapers/magazines as well as snacks is limited. Surprisingly there was beer and hard liquor but no wine available. Internet computers are available for free. Nice and welcoming staff. Shower was great with lots of towels and toiletries.,lounge
1900,I concur with the former comment. Either they didn't refurbish the Amex lounge or no result was visible. Clean but empty. Just a place to seat a rest room and nothing to eat. No internet connexion. I went out.,lounge
1901,This is a lounge that could improve. A choice of drinks comfortable seats but little food and an internet connection that comes and goes. But the staff are nice and announcements are made timely. The location of the lounge itself (near the gates) is convenient but the gates location are not (you have to walk across the entire terminal and to use stairs so if you have any duty-free shopping to do you should plan to do it before going to the lounge).,lounge
1902,Staff excellent. Clean toilet / shower facilities. Nice view from upper floor. Free Internet. Reasonable food selection and good drink selection. One minute from security checks to gates. Much quieter than Zurich. Bar seating café-style seating leather armchair and relaxer seating upstairs.,lounge
1903,A very poor lounge on all fronts; a tiny lounge with no windows and hideously cold air conditioning. Although not full (that really would have been disastrous) it felt cramped and unwelcoming. A meagre selection of food available some nice Kenyan finger food and the usual beverage selection. Counters near the food were unclean and food looked unappetizing (although to my surprise it was good). Internet was slow and only 1 terminal available. It was a welcome break from the very old terminal building which was very overcrowded but far below par for a Star Alliance/SWISS lounge and very disappointing.,lounge
1904,Swiss use the Millenium lounge - quite a pleasant experience. Staff was friendly and efficient there were two or three computers with internet but no wifi. Seating quite comfortable and generous. The food selection was very good in comparison to other lounges : fresh healthy things like crudites goat cheese savoury and sweet pastry sandwiches. The drinks selection was equally impressive. Despite most areas were naturally lit the disadvantage was perhaps the lack of any view towards the outside.,lounge
1905,Like everything in Guarulhos airport TAM's lounge is too small. Signalling is poor: the lounge is located on the second floor (turn left just after passport control before entering the duty free shop). But generally you will find a place to seat in one of the three rooms. The selection of snacks is not wide but fresh and they can fix you a caipirinha if you ask for it. It has a shower (what a blessing!) and if you use it they will give you a nice selection of L'Occitane toiletries. The Wi-Fi works well. Sometimes a musician plays the piano. Announcements are made timely. Staff are helpful and proficient in English sometimes in Spanish.,lounge
1906,The lounge is nice but what is strange is that the offerings between the adjacent business class lounge and the supposedly higher Senator lounge is not that different. The bar selection is identical. Senator offered a few more snacks and a pasta with spinach dish. Business had a curry dish. Both were very good. The Senator lounge has two levels and there is no elevator to the second floor. So you need to ask one of the attendants to open the door if you want to use the elevator which is in the Business lounge. The seating is modern and good.,lounge
1907,Very nice lounge great views across the runways and good selection of drinks (including different champagnes) and hot food with a restaurant section. Pleasant showers to freshen up and a leather seated limo service to take you to the E Terminal for the long haul flights. Staff the usual Swiss efficient but seemed friendly and were very helpful.,lounge
1908,In the old days of Swiss Air there were no lounge facilities at Rome Fiumincino. Today the use a lounge on pier E opposite gate 31 which is run by Alitalia staff. To enter you need to use the lift and go down a floor. This means the lounge has no windows. On entering there were 3 receptionists. Non of them were interested in serving me they were too busy on their mobiles. I stood like an idiot for 3 minutes for one of them to say hello. The lounge is not a nice haven. It has old large photo's on the back wall of Rome. It has a bar area toilets and that is just about it. There were no newspapers or magazines. The bar was stocked with basic drinks and beer on tap. The food was terrible curled up sandwiches where you had to search out the filling. The bar attendant was always in the back talking to someone else. I stood for 10 minutes waiting for him to come back to the bar. You could hear him but not see him. The WiFi cost 10 euros per hour which I did not use. There was simply no saving graces to this lounge. This has to be the worst lounge I have EVER used but given the fact that it is run by Alitalia is it any surprise it is so bad. Swiss needs to think about using this lounge it really is bad.,lounge
1909,It is actually the old First Class lounge remodelled and in atmosphere it beats the old lounge. Quite comfortable leather chairs good lighting and new stone walls in beige make nice surroundings. Food and drink selection as in the previous business class lounge. Already quite a lot of people (on Friday evening and Tuesday morning) but all in all a nice place to spend some time.,lounge
1910,Newly opened lounge. Plenty of sitting area good choice of food drinks and snacks. Separate area for dining serving mostly pre-flight dining for night flights. Very much the spirit of the LH First/HON lounge concept. Very nice showers. The whole experience is 'Zen'. You really feel relaxed when you leave the lounge.,lounge
1911,Zurich Swiss First lounge is a separate area within the Swiss Business lounge with a separate reception and service desk. The reception will identify eligibility for car transfer to US bound longhaul gate at the midfield terminal and arrange it with the visiting passenger-a very nice service indeed. Comfortable leather seating. Extensive self service bar extensive soft drinks. Hot drinks machine. Moderate assortment of hot food buffet including soup. Good selection of cold snacks. Swiss style hard cookies. One compact shower for First with access to the several similar Business Class section showers. Access to the Long Bar it is part of the Business Class section and connected to First by stair and a door or exit First section to Business and take the elevator- it faces the tarmac and is a nice feature. One or two computers for use not sure of WiFi. Quiet and relaxing atmosphere Swiss staff efficiency.,lounge
1912,This lounge is too small. It is always full and difficult to find seating. They have a good selection of magazines if you speak Portuguese. Having just spent an hour in the lounge the coffee spilt on the steps was not cleaned. There were no hors d'oeuvres Pepsi and Pepsi light taps were only pouring water there were no small bottles of water and practically every single table was dirty with dirty dishes - yet there were four people in the lounge kitchen. Apparently all too busy having a morning conversation rather than doing their job and making the lounge presentable.,lounge
1913,This lounge dates from prehistory as well as its furniture and decoration. I don't understand what is Lufthansa and other serious Star Alliance companies doing here. The food is poor the drinks are okay. The showers are old but working fine and clean. Overall quite a depressing lounge.,lounge
1914,The lounge is very difficult to find as there are no signs to navigate passengers to the Lounge. I arrived from non-Schengen flight and was transported by bus to the gate and as my flight was to non- Schengen country I passed the security check and entered the terminal where I tried to find the Business Lounge. After some minutes of walking and finding nothing I asked the staff at one of the gates to guide me to the Business Lounge. I had to go back to the Schengen terminal pass the passport control and security check. In the Schengen terminal no signs navigating to the Business Lounge. When I finally managed to find it it was about the time to go back to non-Schengen terminal again through the passport control. The only advantage was that I spent 40 minutes walking which was healthy exercise between 2 flights. I had a little chance to use the Business Lounge but the first impression was a strange light and very small space but a good selection of refreshment but no time to enjoy.,lounge
1915,"Very nice airport and efficient public transportation. Staff is helpful and friendly. However the lounge is terrible. It is difficult to find but has nice views over the boarding areas. Food is just peanuts and a tiny dry ""montaditos"" which are gone in a second. When asked for more the staff did not bother. Coffee is another joke a coffee machine which pours ""black water"" has nothing to do with nice portuguese coffee.",lounge
1916,I like this quirky lounge. The staff is young and polite and willing to help. They sometimes take care of my carry-on which I can leave for some hours while in town. I can understand some people do not like the atmosphere. Pasteis de Nata and other salt pasteos are to die for. All the food is pretty much the same bit is replenished regularly. Wifi and PC work fine. My concern is that it is very cold. You need a blanket in the summer as they keep it below 18 degrees.,lounge
1917,Being a Gold lounge for the Star Alliance standards it is very poor. Low light level give you the feeling of being in a night club. Food choice and quality very limited and poor. Staff service as for TAP airline very rude and not polite. Total lack of professionalism.,lounge
1918,TAP uses the ANA lounge at Porto Airport. Lounge with good selection of snacks and drinks. There is no bathroom. Workstations and no wi-fi including chargers for smartphones.,lounge
1919,The lounge has a reasonable quantity and quality of drinks sandwiches and various snacks. Comfortable chairs with wi-fi and desktop workstations. TAP employees especially rude in dealing with passengers. The lounge has only three toilets insufficient for the large number of passengers in the lounge.,lounge
1920,Nice ambience spacious comfortable lounge reasonable selection of drinks and sandwiches though nothing hot. Delicious Portuguese baked custard pastries! Couple of free internet terminals and range of newspapers in different languages. Desk attendant helpful. One of the better lounges in Europe and the food selection puts other Star Alliance European airlines to shame!,lounge
1921,"Low selection of food. Just some chips and nuts. There is also some Romanian yoghurt, but no hot food. No obvious place to charge iPad or iPhone. Chairs are hard, and there is no air conditioning, which makes for a very hot lounge in the summer. The selection of drinks is fine.",lounge
1922,The lounge is okay with one exception - terribly bad WIFI service. The service really only works very close to the entrance. They have a very complex username/passwd system that essentially is broken. On most devices you simply never get the page where you should enter the login information. Browsing leads to connection failed messages etc.,lounge
1923,"Thailand is the country in the world where the service is always the best as truly part of the culture (I've been to Thailand for 40 years!) but Thai Airways has totally forgotten that. Everything worn out (and by the way their domestic lounge is even much worse), food terrible (and I love Thai food), choice of drinks very limited (not one single wine but I was told by the staff that I could get some from another of their business lounge located 900 meters walk away) and staff barely polite. Thai Airways  used to be a good airline but now it's a shame for it's wonderful country.",lounge
1924,"I have been using this lounge for 7 years now and it keeps going downhill. The furniture is the same as it was when the lounge opened. There has been no upkeep. The food is very average. A few hot snacks like dim sum, and cold tiny sandwiches. There was one juice with no sugar, apple juice. no alcohol or beer. In the toilets the handle is broken off and the door is scratched and in poor condition. I will just stop using the lounge and wait at the gate from now on or go to a restaurant. It is somewhat depressing in there.",lounge
1925,The staff were very professional and accommodating however the food and the items on offer were largely unappetizing. The lounge was clean but the facilities were quite crowded because of the sheer number of airlines who use the lounge with Thai.,lounge
1926,We were lucky to get there early (around 7pm) so we got the good seats. After about one hour the lounge was overcrowded. It felt like sitting at the gate with kids running and screaming and lots of people standing waiting for available seats. The food is not impressive at all. The drinks is low average (beer coke and waters). Its a bar at the opposite end with 2-3 wines and some drinks. Wifi works well. Staff is good and trying to accommodate. The restrooms are OK. Across the hallway (concourse D) is the Spa. This is very nice and quiet - great free foot massage / neck massage for business class (more options for first). In all fairness I believe this lounge would be a lot better to visit morning or mid day when less people. Overall it is better at the lounge than outside so I will recommend it.,lounge
1927,Used this lounge as a Qatar Airways customer - Thai Airways seems to be having serious financial issues and the quality of their lounges in Bangkok have gone down tremendously over the past two years. In this instance the lounge was grossly overcrowded with many airlines passengers. There were literally no seats available when I entered and I am writing this review standing up hoping for a seat. The beverage selection was average and the food selection well below average. The staff tried to help and were cheerful but were facing a much bigger crowd than the lounge was designed to handle or than the number of personnel could handle. Because of the big crowd the lounge bathrooms were rarely available and the general cleanliness was not good. I assume this is all a reflection of Thai Airways trying to rent out as many seats as possible in their lounge but I will not fly Qatar from Bangkok if the lounge situation does not improve.,lounge
1928,"Nice and spacious. On a Friday noon we were at no time more than 5-6 travellers in the lounge. The selection of food changes at 11 am from breakfast to lunch setting. The presentation was nice and the quality was ok. The champagne was very ""brut"". Considering that CDG is no home base for any Star Alliance airline it is a nice and comfortable lounge to wait in and even with a limited view to the runways.",lounge
1929,Visited the lounge in Concourse E as I had a 8 hour transit between flights. The lounge does not have a lot of space as there are many seats in a relatively small area compared to some other lounges. however some different hot dinner offerings were available as well as plenty of alcohol to help yourself to. So overall I was quite happy with the lounge even though it seemed a bit small with many flights departing over the time I was there everyone seemed to be able to get a seat. I also used the shower facilities which were excellent and a great way to freshen up prior to the flight.,lounge
1930,Marginally better than sitting in the airport at the gate. Pretty average but at least I had a shower. Thai seems to be 10 years behind the times with aircraft on key routes and the lounge experience confirmed.,lounge
1931,Basic Sleeping beds available in lounge. It was unfortunate that the staff members were quite noisy and they shouted occasionally. They were quite inconsiderate.,lounge
1932,The worst Business Lounge I have been in recent years. Food offer is negligible basically non existant wine is not on offer espresso machine better buy one outside - very bad experience indeed. Why TG has got such a low class Lounge?,lounge
1933,Lounge is spacious and nice ambient staff is very friendly and helpful. But best of all the royal massage spa which really different and genuine Thai super service. Bar could be improved further from existing one.,lounge
1934,Recently upgraded so the furnishings and carpets are new. The Business and First Class lounge reception desk is right outside the First Class lounge door so there is constant noise coming from the reception desk into the lounge . The hot food on offer looks awful and would be best avoided. There are no showers in the lounge and the drinks refrigerator needs repairing. The only upside to this lounge is that it is not as crowded as the Business lounge.,lounge
1935,A very crowded lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport. The seats are okay specially the new ones by the entrance. They only serve snacks like spring rolls small pies etc. and sandwiches. They serve whisky gin cognac etc but no wine at all! We asked for red wine and one of the ladies working there came up with red Martini fantastic! You are forced to drink heavy liquor in stead of wine. I think it is the only lounge I have been to which has this very bad policy. They used to have wine and even cocktails but they have changed. We love Thai Airways but not their lounge at Bkk Airport! I really hope we will be able to get wine again.,lounge
1936,Disappointing experience yet again. I do not understand why this lounge is so poor in choice of snacks and beverages for Thai's premium passengers. It used to be top line now it's below mediocre. I'm switching back to Singapore Airlines for my monthly travels to and from Bangkok. With SQ I get much more value for a slightly higher price all the way including on the ground.,lounge
1937,"I used this lounge from flying with Qatar Airways Business class. This lounge is getting worse every time I visit. Despite consistent service at the reception and cleaning after customers the food and drink selection is smaller and worse. The microwave heated puffs and dim-sums are now ""not quite there"". They are left empty for at least 30 mins until I asked a staff what was wrong. Occasionally the staff would have a table full of instant ramen noodles. Making me wonder now if this was a true business class lounge or a ""free-for-all customers"" lounge provided by another neighboring airline. Most seats are still grouped in 4. Making it appear more crowded almost automatically.",lounge
1938,Sitting in the lounge at the moment. This is one of the best if not the best lounge I have been to. In particular the service is exceptional.,lounge
1939,TG in its hub goes on with a terrible lounge that has been there for a long time. The airport is very modern but the lounge is run down with old and uncomfortable seats. Food and drinks very basic; no wine no beer. No announcements which is standard in lunges but something unbelievable no screen with departing flights we nearly missed ours as it was miles away from the lounge.,lounge
1940,Royal First Lounge prior to taking night flight with Thai to LHR. As usual the staff are plentiful friendly and efficient. I have only two negative points about this lounge. The first is the design fault which allows all the noise of the concourse into the lounge as the plate glass windows have large areas open to the main terminal area. This is particularly noticeable in the private sitting rooms. The second also relates to those sitting rooms. Although comfortable they have one draw back. It is very difficult to get the attention of staff without getting up and going to the corridor which runs along the front of the row of sitting rooms. Staff are always passing by but never glance into the rooms. This problem could be easily solved by adding a call button which switched a light outside the room. Possibly too it is time to at least clean if not replace some of the carpets in the sitting rooms.,lounge
1941,Guest of Swiss as they utilise this Lounge as a Star Alliance member. Crowded due to the number of member flights departing in the 2100-2359 period with seating difficult to find. Within the lounge only beer and soft drinks plus tea and coffee can be self served eventually the bar was located but in the odd location at the bottom of the escalators leading to the lounges (first and business) and before reception. Drinks are dispensed by a bar tender - two staff coping with a packed lounge. To top it off there wasn't a choice of white wine variety there wasn't any white wine at all! For a nation's flag ship carrier which has about five lounges at this airport to have no white wine is astounding and reflects poorly on Swiss which has no say in the matter.,lounge
1942,Found the lounge relaxing with plenty of cold hot snacks available alcohol beer wine and soft drinks available. Spent 3 hours in this lounge with a call at Royal Orchid lounge for a massage. Only complaint is the long walk from one end to the other for the use of the bar. Lounge was quiet so no problems.,lounge
1943,The big let down with the Thai business class lounges is the quality of food they offer. This time I had a pleasant surprise in that they had some very tasty chicken tikka in the hot selection but the rest was the usual poor quality sandwiches hot dog rolls and restricted fruit selection. They also scrimp on some of the drink choices too - especially gin and lack of any wine. As a frequent flyer its a better than average lounge but if paying full business class fare I would not be impressed.,lounge
1944,My second visit to the lounge in 3 months. No improvement in the quality and choices of food and drinks. The food was unpalatable with such limited choices the lounge placed cup noodles as their best item on offer. As a Singaporean I am well aware that good quality food and drinks are very reasonably priced in this country so why does Thai Airways stinge on this I wonder. The seats are fine and the lounge is quiet. No showers or even toilets available you'll have to use the public toilets outside the lounge. Skip the lounge and head to the restaurants for better food.,lounge
1945,The main business class lounge THAI offer their Royal Silk passengers is a worn out place. The seats shows that they are very old and despite the free internet its hardly a place to charge the battery of your computer. I use this lounge many times a year but I am surprised every time I enter the doors. There are two other lounges available however despite the fact that they are newer and cleaner the relatively small lounges are often overcrowded.,lounge
1946,Spent 2 hours in this lounge at midnight with about 30 wide-bodied flights departing (including Star alliance partners). The lounge was packed full not one seat available. It had clearly been used for hours with dirt and crumbs everywhere. The food was okay at best a couple sandwich selections and some sweets but nothing special. Staff were courteous but don't give out internet password unless you ask for it (after you sit down and get situated its annoying to have to get up and ask). This is supposed to be their flagship lounge and airport- not impressed.,lounge
1947,The lounge was quite clean and calm even though it shared with other Star Alliance customers. Food and Beverage selection was not bad. Plus the view from the lounge was superb.,lounge
1948,The service is excellent the food offerings can be selected from an iPad listing and if you wish they book you for a massage in the Royal Spa. There was no aspect of the experience that I could imagine improving and the experience was like no other I have had.,lounge
1949,In Mumbai Thai Airways does not have its exclusive lounge. It shares its lounge with certain other Star Alliance Airlines. Celebrations lounge is not half as good as other lounges I have had the opportunity to be in around the world. It's like a 3 star hotel lobby. There's only one bathroom. The amenities are minimal. The food is nothing to be proud of either. But the courteous staff get full marks.,lounge
1950,The worst international lounge I've ever encountered. A small yellow room overstuffed with chairs no tables a waiting room the size of a large living room. Food is questionable and limited alcohol is basic. I can't believe you pay business or first class air fares to receive this perk.,lounge
1951,Excellent lounge but compared with their lounge in BKK it has little less facilities. (Shower other service). But food and view is absolutely better than other airline lounges in HKG.,lounge
1952,I've used this lounge fairly often I gradually seeing improvements to the rock-hard seats. Cuisines have now been added to most seats. Unfortunately in terms of the snack and drink options this lounge fares worse than a lot of other airlines. For some very odd reasons there is no alcoholic beverages offered. In addition to this light snacks such as nuts crisps or crackers are nowhere to be found. Wi-Fi doesn't seem to work due to the capacity has been reached. I would say for today's airlines standard this lounge is really sub-par.,lounge
1953,I spent a dismal 90 minutes prior to an 0020 departure in this extremely poor business class lounge. Apart from the complimentary drinks almost everything about the lounge is dreadful in the late evening hours when many medium- and long-haul flights are departing. Finding a seat is difficult the seats themselves are small and uncomfortable the snack-type food on offer is decades behind what other legacy carriers now offer at this time of day and the reading material is limited. Next time I shall just pay to spend the time at one of the public restaurants!,lounge
1954,The service and staff are great but unfortunately there is no quiet place. Even the private rooms (with no door) are open to the public terminal at the back side with all the announcements in full volume. This Lounge is no place to rest.,lounge
1955,The Thai Airways lounge in Manila Terminal 1 (MNL) is the worst lounge ever. It is tiny and everyone sits shoulder to shoulder in very small chairs. There is not enough seating to accommodate all business class customers. There are only a few coffee tables so you must hold your plate and drinks on your lap. Very few outlets to charge devices. This lounge is a disgrace.,lounge
1956,Flying MH to KL so given access to TG lounge E. The lounge was dark and looked tired. Staff were efficient and pleasant enough and worked efficiently to clear plates and glasses. The food on offer was very disappointing. A few sandwiches prawn nuggets(!) dim sum dumplings vegetable pies a few miserable dry pastries and some fruit. This is Thailand so where was the Thai food? They had a god selection of liquor but no wine on offer. Wi-fi was good and there was sufficient reading material on offer. The bathrooms were small and weren't very clean and there were two shower rooms for use separate from the toilets. There was a reasonable view of the tarmac but overall it was not a great experience. I felt like I was in the lobby of a 3 star hotel.,lounge
1957,Thai does not have access to a proper lounge and instead contracts with Alitalia. As such one is treated to the poor quality that Alitalia has become famous for. Limited food options consisted of dried out quiche some sort of bread and tomato pastry and nothing else. In fairness to Thai Airways this may be the best it can offer as Alitalia seems to have been given the monopoly on lounges in the terminal. All I can say is why bother? There is no service no assistance and nothing relaxing about the lounge. I was more comfortable wandering about the oppressively hot terminal than in sitting in the foul smelling lounge. Thai should make an effort and see what it subjects its clients to.,lounge
1958,The selection of food in this business class lounge is abysmal. For instance this morning's breakfast offering - as it has been every morning the last 10 years I've flown the airline - was boiled slices of sandwich ham hot dogs and boiled eggs along with an assortment of industrial-grade dim sum and tea sandwiches. I find TG's poor quality food inexplicable given Thailand's deserved reputation for affordable tasty cuisine. There are too few toilets many of which are out-of-service; self-service bar options have been removed with liquor placed in a service bar at the extreme end (outside the main seating area) of a 200 meter lounge; and the internet is often unavailable or so slow that Outlook hangs. In short give this lounge a miss if you have become accustomed to quality business class travel.,lounge
1959,Thai Airways use the SAS lounge at T3 Heathrow which is quite big split over two floors with views out towards the runways. The seating varies from comfortable armchairs to bar stools  there are also segregated rooms for business use and a children's area. Lots of computer stations on the ground floor with a decent snack bar and a good choice of wines  beer and soft drinks. Upstairs each seating area had power points and wifi available to connect laptops plus another snack bar with a selection of food and drinks available including draught beer on tap. The staff did the job but not much interaction with the passengers  washrooms clean and tidy and overall ok for a short visit but would not want to be there on a long delay.,lounge
1960,We had the misfortune to visit the Alitalia Lounge which Thai Airways use in Rome. This would have to be the worst Business Class Lounge we have ever experienced. There was nowhere to sit when we first arrived even though I have to use a stick. When I finally found somewhere to sit the cream lounge chairs were filthy. The floor looked like it needed a good clean also. There was no food except peanuts and tiny biscuits. There were no clean glasses. Eventually some dried out sandwiches arrived which vanished as quick as they came. The staff gave the impression they did not want to be there and on the whole it was a very unpleasant experience. Is this the best Thai Airways can offer their loyal Business Class Passengers?,lounge
1961,The lounge is a reasonable size for the number of passengers but can get quite busy. The layout is not bad but not the best compared to other lounges at the airport. Food is quite limited but the drinks available are plentiful and varied. The toilets and showers were modern and clean but no toiletries supplied  staff seemed hard working and friendly. Overall not a bad lounge for a short stay but would not like to be there on a long flight delay.,lounge
1962,The main lounge is quite large with plenty of seating but a little bit tired and worn  the other smaller business lounge is more comfortable with a good selection of food and variety of drinks on offer. Staff very friendly and willing to help  washrooms and shower kept in good order but can get very busy at certain times.,lounge
1963,Relatively simple functional lounge. Seats are comfortable' however the lighter colour ones are prone to staining. No sofas/couches. Food options are mainly for the Asian market (to be expected in Hong Kong) so doesn't leave much for western tastes particularly at breakfast. Nice and quiet on a Sunday morning as not many TG flights and I was on Air NZ. Offered a shower but declined.,lounge
1964,This is the Star Alliance lounge open to many customers. First impressions are not good: cold poorly lit and noisy (with low ceilings). Food looks poor and wine selection is terrible. No champagne few magazines: really a disappointment for a premium destination.,lounge
1965,The Royal Silk Lounge is right after immigration and allows for easy access. Staff nice and friendly and a lot of seats available. Food selection always the same and it is a pity they do not offer any nice Thai food only some snacks. Drinks selection is good. The location of the lounge does not really give good views and it is quite loud at times with announcements from the terminal building and one can constantly hear the moving walkways warning people that it ends. As we only spent 25min in the lounge before boarding it was fine however I would not want to be stuck there for a long transit. Next time I will try another Royal Silk Lounge at BKK.,lounge
1966,Good spacious lounge. A little dark but comfy good food available in the morning but only snacks not really breakfast items full bar available self serve and friendly smiling staff shower room is ok only 2 showers but wasn't busy when I was there.,lounge
1967,Flying a Star alliance carrier gave me a choice between the United Red Carpet Lounge or the Thai Airways Lounge. It was a no brainer and I opted for TG which offers a superior lounge experience to North American carriers. The TG lounge while not as good as BKK was still top quality. There was an assortment of hot & cold foods along with a decent beverage option. The lounge was crowded but there were still some seats available. First Class passengers have little designated private booth type seating areas and again it is less impressive than the TG 1st experience in BKK. I did have a chuckle though as the seating option and lounge experience that the 1st class PAX had was hardly worth the fare difference between 1st and Business. The only negative aspect of the lounge was the absence of electric sockets where one could plug in a laptop.,lounge
1968,A small lounge with comfy chairs and toilets. Reasonable selection of drinks and small selection of food. Not many people in lounge as I was waiting.,lounge
1969,Has to be the best First Class lounge. The service is second to none. From the moment you check-in they take you through a special customs area and down the escalators and then a buggy is waiting to take you to the lounge. My family was traveling and we had our own room and the service did not stop - we were there for 5 hours. There is a dining room which you select off the menu and so it keeps going on. This is the lounge you want when you have a long transit. When we arrived back into Bangkok from Rome they picked us up in buggies from the airbridge and drove us all the way to our luggage which was waiting the staff then collected and escorted us out to our waiting bus which took us to our hotel - did not touch our bags since we left Rome until we got to the hotel.,lounge
1970,I've had the unfortunate circumstance of being stuck in long layovers thrice in the last year at BKK. If it weren't for the high quality lounge I think I would have gone a bit batty. It's basically a very large lounge and mostly self serve everything. Also if you have a long layover the lounge offers complimentary 30 minute Thai massages which I found quite nice. Internet Facilities and speed is excellent. The food selection is mostly hors d'oeuvres type but there is many to choose from.,lounge
1971,The lounge is looking a bit tired and tatty but still clean and tidy plenty of food and drink with very attentive staff. No shower available but there is a spa lounge. Toilets kept clean by very friendly staff and glasses plates etc removed promptly. Flight info screens but no loudspeaker broadcasts which makes for a more relaxing stay.,lounge
1972,During our long layover at BKK we got to experience lounges on both concourses D and C. Whilst the lounge on concourse D was much bigger and had a slightly better range of food on offer I was surprised that to have a shower you had to move to the smaller lounge on Concourse C. Not very convenient when you're tired. The food and drinks on offer were of high standard and staff were cleaning the tables and replenishing the food. Except for the shower issue it was a pleasant long layover.,lounge
1973,I use the Lounge in BKK at least every 2 weeks with same experience. No wines offered since years only fat puff pastry small Sandwich and Chinese Steam-buns Stale rolls Toast Jam Butter and sometimes cold cuts. Some cakes are available too. Either the puff pastry or the Steam-buns are cold. Bangkok is the Homebase of Thai and have the worst Lounge.,lounge
1974,Modern and clean lounge with efficient and friendly staff. comfortable lounge seats good showers and toilets and a good variety of food (changed every couple of hours). The espresso/cappuccino machine did the job. Wifi was easy to connect to and fast. Low light : no wine in the lounge. Odd that. Not much of a cost saving if it forces passengers to consume the spirits!,lounge
1975,We have used this lounge many times in the past and been more than happy. However this time it was a bit disappointing to see the quality had dropped. The wine and champagne selection used to be wonderful this time they were of a much cheaper standard. I have had better when flying in economy. They do offer a good selection of food and the lounge is clean and comfortable.,lounge
1976,Not at all what you would expect from a Business Class Lounge. It was was understaffed most of the tables were filled with dirty plates and cutlery. The lounge looks old and run down. Very poor selection of food. Puff rolls filled with chicken mushrooms quiches and some very tired looking fruit. The selection has been the same for about 3 years. Thai airways Business Lounges have to be the only ones in the world without wine!! The airlines make a lot of money from their business class passengers so Thai airways should be able to afford to upgrade their lounges.,lounge
1977,From the greeting at kerbside pick up where your luggage and check in are dealt with whilst you relax to the buggy that takes you to the lounge. The itself is spacious and clean with very attentive staff. We were placed in our own side lounge on our outward journey and then in mini slumber rooms on our return as our stopover was quite long. After sleeping we showered in the clean bathrooms then ate in the restaurant with all food freshly cooked. The Spa was sensational total relaxation. We were then escorted from the lounge to our seats on the aircraft.,lounge
1978,This is great lounge in the heart of the airport good for transfers. I prefer this lounge to the larger lounge one is directed towards on entering the airport. Having just done a leg from London to BKK I was able to shower in very well kept facilities before the last leg of the journey. The showers were powerful and hot towels large and fluffy just as they should be. I had time for a sit down and gin and tonic before the departure of my flight - my only gripe was the lack of a glass of wine - I guess a cultural thing. Wifi connection was easy.,lounge
1979,A little oasis of quiet in an otherwise very busy terminal. The lounge is spacious on 2 levels with a variety of seating and some very nice Macs in the Internet Areas. I thought the food and drinks choices were pretty basic but okay for a short visit. SAS London Lounge makes T3 almost bearable - almost.,lounge
1980,The lounge was understaffed: one woman was responsible for cleaning and catering in the two hours prior to the departure of a TG flight. Many tables were piled up with dirty plates and cutlery and weren't cleaned in the time I was there. There were no glasses at all for drinks - you had to ask. Small and unappealing selection of baked items as well as cups of noodles. Spirits and beer available but no wine. A very disappointing lounge.,lounge
1981,The least impressive business lounge I have seen for some time. Cramped dingy and full of mosquitoes. My family moved to the main waiting area one by one driven out by the depressing atmosphere frequent insect bites and noise from one extended family with small children.,lounge
1982,The staff food and service here are all excellent. Staff most helpful with connecting flights. Great internet access very fast. Must be one of the world's best airport lounges.,lounge
1983,Great Lounge. I travelled Swiss First Class and thus was invited to use the THAI AIRWAYS Lounge. Unfortunately the usage of the SPA is only permitted for THAI customers not for pax from partner airlines. Welcome at the desk is very friendly professional. Seating is very comfortable THAI also offers separate suites all were reserved though seemingly for THAI pax only. The service is professional friendly and unobtrusive. All kinds of drinks and cocktails are served. At the seat snacks are on offer from a snack menu. In case of major appetite some main courses international and Thai dishes can be ordered and are served in the cozy little restaurant at the end of the lounge. A big selection of national and international newspapers and magazines is spread out. Also a nice touch for me a small smokers lounge separate from the other lounge areas is available and drinks are served there also. Finally a very nice and comfortable lounge quiet and giving privacy.,lounge
1984,Not what you would expect in a Business Class Lounge. Over years still the same poor selection on finger food. Puff rolls filled with Chicken Mushrooms Vegetarian Quiches some fruit soup. They have a good variety on drinks but no red/white wine as most others offer. Internet access is quite good. After I visited a few times the Thai Lounge in Hong Kong I was even more disappointed about the Bangkok Lounge at the Home base!,lounge
1985,This Lounge has been open 3 years now and the earlier problems (poor air conditioning gloomy corridor like interior dreadful toilets) all remain unchanged - as has the snacks menu. Three years on and they still offer precisely the same collection of dreary sandwiches and pastries. The Internet Room appeared to be a play area for children when I visited. There's a reasonable drinks choice but not as good as the old lounges in Don Muang - they now have a small Duty Free Shop which is a useful provision. Perhaps they could channel some of the profit from that into fixing the problems in the lounge. Airlines make a lot of profit from their Business Class Customers and it would be nice to see some of this put back into the Lounge at Thai's home airport.,lounge
1986,For Thai's Flagship Business Class Lounge this was disappointing. Though the seating arrangements were comfortable the long layout made it feel like you're sitting in a corridor. The food selection was pathetic; a couple of small hot quiches and sausage rolls a few white bread sandwiches and cup-noodles. Not what you would expect in a Business Class Lounge. Good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.,lounge
1987,The Best First Class Lounge ever visit until now. Welcome begins at the gate on arriving of the plane go by an electric cart to the Royal First Lounge. I was assigned a private room with large HD TV. 2 dedicated lounge hostesses for the services during the entire stay. An extensive menu is presented. You can eat in a 5-stars restaurant setting or in your own private lounge. You will be the last to board. A hostess will call personally for your flight and take you to the gate by an electric cart and to your seat on the plane.,lounge
1988,The First class lounge is an oasis. Attentive staff that really are taking care of you. Nice private living room area. Food and drinks on demand. The Spa for First class passengers is amazing with nice amenities and also a 1hr massage is included. Only wifi was a bit slow but and could not find a menu for drinks and meals. However it was overall a nice experience.,lounge
1989,This is one of the best lounges worldwide. A lot of staff is caring about all needs. They have a dining menu with a wide selection of food if you want eat before your flight. Thai Airways passengers are invited to the spa where a free oil/neck and shoulder or foot massage is offered. But between 9.00 pm and midnight due to many departures the lounge is overcrowded and sometimes very noisy. The washrooms are very big with a nice selection of L'occitane products. After every use someone comes for cleaning.,lounge
1990,The main lounge is very long and doesn't really provide a very cosy feel. Staff are abundant friendly and attentive. Free WiFi access is available and it's adequate but quite slow. One gripe that so many of us have is the lack of power easily accessible power outlets for our laptops. The Thai lounge at Suvarnabhumi is fairly new and it's a shame that the designers didn't do what most modern airports are doing (such as NRT) and provide easily accessible outlets for every seat. One major bonus is the offer of a 20 minute massage in the adjacent First Class spa with options for either a foot massage or a head and neck massage. Perfect for relaxing just prior to boarding. My biggest complain would be the catering which is limited to dry snacks small cheap white bread sandwiches instant noodle and various small but rather oily warm pies. The Thai lounge really pales in comparison to their competition in this area. It's also interesting to me that the food catering is actually much better in Thai lounges at other airports Hong Kong for example where various hot dishes are provided and even ice cream. Even the dingy overcrowded Thai lounge at MNL offers a better food catering service. One would think that Thai's flagship home base lounges would provide the best catering but this is not the case.,lounge
1991,It offers fairly basic comfort levels but would expect more from the home airport for Transaero Airlines. No shower was possible during my stopover and disappointed by that. Internet was okay lounge not too crowded when I visited (midday) but food choice was quite limited. Did noty find the staff friendly - they seemed to be poor on English language skills and just stared at me politely for most questions.,lounge
1992,Late transfer staff helpful directed me to a decent sized shower room (with toilet) to freshen up for the next flight ahead. Busy lounge with relatively few seats but quiet enough and clean. Very little reading material but ok to sit and relax. Food selection mostly cold pastry products and poor quality sugary desserts. Internet access through terminals that I wouldn't trust as PCs concerned had vast amounts of software that had been installed on them by past users. Biggest inconvenience is having to queue up for security between lounge and gates with no priority queue. Overall great staff comfortable environment good shower/bathroom facilities but needs a big rethink on food.,lounge
1993,Am lucky enough to use the business lounge at Bangkok frequently and since the new airport opened I can say how much better the lounge is. The lighting is tranquil and soothing with plenty of comfortable seating. The staff are more than accommodating constantly replenishing the snacks and drinks and keeping all areas spotless. The washrooms too are very good and clean - always important when your about to board a flight and need to freshen up. All in all an excellent lounge with all you require before the start of your journey.,lounge
1994,What an amazing service - we were greeted by Thai Staff as we enter the separate entrance to First Class check-in at the Airport. Our bags and tickets were taken and check-in completed by Thai Staff whilst we were seated in comfort. We were then escorted thru immigrations then onto a private buggy vehicle to the first class lounge. Truly amazing and beautiful lounge and extremely attentive staff. We were shown to a private room with lounge table working desk with wifi plug and flat screen tv. You could actually choose what you would like to eat and it was all prepared fresh and delivered to our mini suite. This is one of those memorable 5 star experiences that I will always remember.,lounge
1995,This has to be one of the worst First Class lounges I have ever been in. It was suppose to be a First Class lounge but I believe they were letting anyone in. The lounge was old and tired and in need of a complete overhaul. When I entered the lounge I was told I would have to PAY 10 Euro for the wifi connection. The best they could do for catering was a pizza mangled into odd shapes and pieces thrown on a plate. Seating and decor was very uncomfortable and out dated. I actually walked out to the airport toilets as the lounge toilets were a disgrace.,lounge
1996,Used the lounge twice in July and really quite impressed! Got a buggy ride from arrival aircraft straight to the lounge. Plenty of seats in the lounge but best part is the Thai Spa facility opposite - had a truly relaxing massage here and some health drinks that were just great. Staff in the lounge really nice and very efficient. Food not so good compared to many First Class lounges today and maybe Thai can improve that. Washrooms and shower rooms immaculate and nice amenities. A small sleep / quiet area but did not use that this time. Goof WiFi access and this was consistent.,lounge
1997,Thai share the Air New Zealand lounge at Sydney Airport. My experience was not a happy one. This started with my being initially refused entry by the guy at the front desk because 'my name was not on the list' . Turns out he had the wrong list and was using the passenger list for TG992 from the night before. I must have been the first for the morning flight to Bangkok to arrive. Half an hour later I'm finally admitted but then met with noisy kids and a dull lounge. Better than no lounge at all but I did not stay there long.,lounge
1998,Used the Lounge before E Gate. Good beverage selection but boring Food selection. Never changed in 5 years or longer? Don't understand the 4 seat arrangement as most travelers are alone and use the time with their Laptops. Sockets are very limited. Often problems with the coffee machines which are full stickers and leftovers of tape glue. Aircon not very good as in the whole Airport. WIFI often crash. Friendly Staff and good cleaning of tables. Kids Playground available as well as Computer rooms. No Flight information screens available so watch your time. Overall I liked the Dong Muang Lounges at all locations much more.,lounge
1999,"Classic Thai welcome on arrival - very airy lounge with more private areas leading off. Comfortable seating and a full dining area if required. Full choice of food - freshly prepared to order - do not help yourself! The club sandwich is as good as it gets. Full bar inc champagne but disappointed with the reds - no Pinot Noir. Staff will escort you the 50 yds to the Spa for a complimentary massage - well worth doing to ease jet lag. There are showers and private cabins with sleeper seats for longer stopovers. If there is a gripe it is that the toilets are ""no flushing of tissues"". I know that the whole of the airport waste disposal is based on this principal but I havn't experienced this since some 30 years ago I had a holiday in a Greek Taverna! The whole Thai First experience - aircraftcabin service ground service and the First Lounge makes Thai the only carrier to use in and out of its home base.",lounge
1700,"I have been buying records from this building for the last 20 years.  I was so happy when I heard that Karl Hendricks was taking over the space.  I feel like the selection has gotten even more fine tuned.  They have a wonderful selection of obscure vinyl.  And every one in the store is always so helpful.  Every time I go there I see one of my friends!!!  I love this place.
",others
1701,"We found tons of great vinyl records here. Excellent prices. The dollar bins held all of the treasures.
",others
1702,"Again, we love this place. The staff is so pleasant. Vinyl selection is the best. This is always a true treasure hunt.  My husband and I are all for the privately owned book stores. Big box stores can't do what these guys can do!
",others
1703,"A treasure trove, a goldmine, frankly the biggest motherload of quality classic vinyl LPs I've *ever* seen!  Imagine 13,000+ sqare feet of jazz, blues, soul, funk, r'n'b, rock, folk, documentaries, comedy, instructionals, soundtracks, etc.

",others
1707,"Seriously if you're a vinyl junkie, don't go here unless you have all day to browse and listen ... I allocated 2 hours and it felt like 15 minutes!!!  I know folks who make special ""record buying"" trips to 'da 'Burgh from Canada, just to go to Jerry's.  Yes, its that good!!
",others
1708,"I have been to Jerry's about 4 times since moving to Squirrel Hill.  On my first visit I came looking for CD's and left with 5 LP's and a turntable!  There is something for everyone here, and lots of hidden treasures.  A truly localuniqueincredible record shopping experience, don't miss it.
",others
1709,"One of the premier record stores in the entire country! Totally amazing. Not overpriced, has a friendly staff who are there because they're into music. Jerry himself is still there most of the time, even though I heard he was trying to retire. Stores like this are the heart and soul of a city's music scene, and I think that Pittsburgh never died as a record town partly because of this very place! Any visit to Pittsburgh requires a visit to Jerry's and then to Paul's CDs.
",others
1710,"Wow, this is almost overwhelming.  I have never experienced an LP store like this one, as others have said it is an unimaginable amount of records.My one critique of others reviews is that: no, he does not have everything.  These are all used or at least collectible unsealed LPs and you will not find anything current here.  No matter, there are troves of other interesting things and you can get 5 of them for what you would normally pay for new vinyl.
",others
1711,"Something for everyone if your into vinyl that is (don't get kinky I am talking records). You can spend hours in this place digging up hidden treasures. I am finding records of bands from the 70's and 80's like Zebra and Twisted Sister who I would see back on LI at the clubs as a teenager (back in the day) when you would get pulled over for drinking and driving and the police would just say walk home and leave your car instead of throwing you in the slammer and then you would pretend to walk home but when the police left you would double back and get in your car again with all your friends and party some more! (ahhh memories).  Huuhhh huum oh yeah ...Jerry's is rockin for records!
",others
1712,"Wow! Too bad I don't have a turntable! 'Cos this place specializes in vinyl. They have records, records, and more records.  Me, I have a huge CD collection.  I don't believe in MP3 players (because if you only have songs downloaded, you don't really have a music collectiom, do you).  There are some purists who believe that the best sound is on vinyl and my father is one of them.  To back up a moment, my husband Rick was out of town for the day on one of his railfan jaunts.  So my brother Paul and I decided to get together, hang out, and maybe get a little Christmas shopping out of the way.  Dad likes music as much as we do,  He even likes more current bands like Arcade Fire and Snow Patrol.  We decided that some used LPs would make a big splash with the old man.  On an earlier family visit, I pilfered his record and CD collection while Paul created a diversion.We decided upon getting him ""Damn the Torpedos"" from Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and a rare LP by The Busboys.  Man, I have got to get me a turntable!  This place is awesome and I could spend hours in here.  Now isn't shopping and browsing at a place like this way more fun than Amazon or E-Bay
",others
1713,"Jerry's sells non-recent music on vinyl, either used or collectible.I've known DJs from NYC who took bookings to Pittsburgh simply for the excuse to go to here.  You can spend hours in this store.They have more records than any other record store I've had the luck to see.   More of their records are things you'd actually want to buy.  Their prices are cheap.  Their staff is friendly.For what they do, I've never seen better.
",others
1714,"It's nearly impossible to beat the size & selection here no matter what city you're in. Pretty much any LP here is $3-$4. It's really easy to spend an entire afternoon digging through all the records that Jerry's has.If you've never been there- hit up the ""NewGood Stuff"" first near the front. This is the dumping ground for incoming records. Most of the good ones get snatched before being filed away.  Another fun thing to do is think of any single that may have been on the jukebox while you were a kidteen. Jerry's has it on 45. (The organization back there is amazing!)Don't forget to bring cash! No credit cards.
",others
1715,"There isn't much to say that hasn't been said, Jerry's is where it's at!
",others
1716,"Wow, these idiots who gave 1 star rating must be dork hipsters who know nothing about record collecting.  I've been a customer at Jerry's since he was in Oakland.  Great guy, great store.  It is one of a kind and known across the world.  You could spend a week going through everything.
",others
1717,"Friendlier than B-Side, less hip (in a good way) than Exclusive, Madcity is where the serious local music-makers (and -lovers) shop. The vinyl selection is AMAZING and the clerks are smart without being smart-ass. What you'll find: midwest artists' releases, newused vinyl, newused CDs, magazines, rarecollectible stuff, and a clerk or two with his finger literally on the pulse of the local rock scene. What you won't find: a clerk that will be willing to special order you the latest Steven Seagal country CD. (Come on, guys, I heard it was really good!)
",others
1718,"Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed MadCity yet. I've been to most of the music stores in town, and they're all pretty good (especially considering that in my neck of the woods now, my selection is limited), but I can confidently say that Madcity is the best. Madcity has a very good selection of vinyl albums, including 45s (which I almost never see anymore even in specialty music stores). There's also an extremely good collection of 60s CDs; most good recordCD shops have plenty of the familiar hit-makers like the Beatles, the Rollings Stones, the Byrds, various Motown artists, etc. How many of them carry music by obscure 60s bands such as Love, or The Gurus Also, their selection of progressive rock (i.e. Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer) is very good as well. Contemporary stuff is in abundance here as well. If  you live in the Madison area you absolutely must come here, and even if you are just visiting the area... you still pretty much need to make a stop here if you are a music enthusiast.
",others
1719,"A great independent music store.  Really good selection (plenty of obscure stuff).  Lots of vinyl.
",others
1720,"This place has the best selection of music in the downtown radius.  Scratch that, the best selection in Madison period.  I don't mean the have the most music, just the best of the best.  And their 50 cent-$1 vinyl selection is pretty fun to browse through.  The owner seems like a pretty cool guy as well which is nice because he's honest and not always trying to sell me up on something unlike the creep at Strictly Discs.  They have a convenient drop box for 4 Star Video too which is handy now that I live on Willy St.  Hey kids, stop all the downloading!  Support your local record shop.
",others
1721,"While in Madison for a day, I needed to find two specific records....The Association and Sniff'n the Tears.  I went to B-side but they didn't have used vinyl. So I checked out Madcity. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile from the guy behind the counter(I soon found out he is the owner).  I was left alone the whole time(which I prefer at record stores).  I was very satisfied with their selection of used vinyl. Madcity is obviously aware that they are catering toward townies and students so they keep their prices appropriate. While I didn't find the two records I was looking for, I did walk away with three gems...Purple Rain by Prince for $3Simon and Garfunkels greatest hits for $3Kick by INXS for $2This is a sweet store with a sweet owner.  No pretention, no games. Just the way I like it.  I even joined the Madcity facebook page...and I don't even live in Madison.
",others
1722,"I've checked out most record stores and this one is at the top of my list. I hate feeling pressured and judged when I shop for music and I've NEVER felt that way here like I do by the pretentious owner at Strictly Discs. The owner of Madcity is pretty chill and friendly, so I never feel intimidated. The selection of vinyl is pretty spectacular too, and at great prices. My favorite thing is their marketing (videos and such)...it's so cheesy and fun that I can tell what kind of environment they create for their customers, and it's very inviting.
",others
1723,"I've been a customer of this store for years.  The best thing I love about this store is you can listen to the used CD's and LP's.  I've found things I would never have bought, but after listening to samples of the CD or LP, picked it up.  It also has worked in reverse, where I've listened to a CD or LP and decided not to buy it.  They also buy used CD's and LP's.
",others
1724,"I was able to find some old, good music in their $1 (50 cents if you buy ten+) sale section. They had the elusive Tribe Called Quest vinyls so I had to pick that up. I didn't know what to expect as I walked in but the guy behind the counter left us alone to browse. He was playing 50's rock and roll, which annoys no one! I even found a vinyl of Juan Gabriel! Maybe the only one in the store but it's mine now. I wouldn't hesitate to be back.. their sale section was filled with so many hidden gems (The Mamas and the Papas, Santo and Johnny, The Supremes to name a few).
",others
1725,"I thought this place was the best...until i moved to San Francisco & visited the jeweled paradise of Amoeba Records. Still, by suburban standards, it rocks! Zia stores have maybe a quarter of the selection of Amoeba (plus, twice as much of a country selection)....but you only need a few handfuls of quarters for purchases here. Those low-down dirty desert prices are everyone's style!

1727,"Zia Record Exchange is an ideal place to locate those hard-to-find CDs you have had no luck finding in those other chain stores and don't want to pay way too much for online. They feature a prominent selection of indie artists from labels such as SubPop and Kill Rock Stars nestled right next to the latest Britney Christina release. You should have no problem finding a few treasures among the aisles and aisles of CDs, used and new. If DVDs are your thing, they offer a fair selection of the typical Hollywood movies. If concert and music DVDs are more up your alley, then this is the place to shop as they have a massive selection of music videos. Vinyl record versions of albums are also available for you DJs out there.It's not called Zia Record EXCHANGE for nothing. You can trade in your used CDs and DVDs when you get tired of them for store credit or for cash. Unless the discs are in pristine condition though, you'll probably be taking them back home with you. Check out their website if you get a chance. You can download a .PDF version of the in-store newsletter for your perusal, or listen to Podcasts featuring music by new and upcoming artists. You'll be sure to discover something new or find that elusive album you've been searching high and low for when you visit Zia Record Exchange.

This old granny even got herself a Zia's Frequent Buyer card [which someday I'll actually figure out what I'm accumulating!]For those newbies to the Valley who don't know what the heck I'm talking about, ZIa's is one of the Valley's institutions of new, used and just plain weird music, movies and games. These days I see that they're also offering other cool and zany stuff.Every time I go out shopping, hubby says, ""You don't need any more CD's do you"" to which I reply, ""Honey, I ALWAYS need new music.""The selection is really fabulous, the prices are low enough not to bust my budget and the vibe is just -- well, how fabulous can the vibe be at 19th Ave. and Indian School Yet Zia's manages to keep the hip factor alive.And if I ever get tired of my music, not that that's ever gonna happen, they'll buy it back. Such a deal!!!
",others
1729,"I've been going to this Zia for 15 years. Yes, I know. It used to be on 7th and Indian School.  Growing up in a lower middle class family, Mom's suggestion to us if we wanted to get new music was to trade in old. And we did. I remember doing the math. If I traded in 4 CD's, I could afford to get 3 used CD's. Not a bad return. Since they moved, they got to expand a touch. They now have a METAL section, which is brutal. No more thumbing through Brittney Spears or Kenny Chesney when I'm looking for some heavy shit. Customer service is always top notch. The customer rewards card is cool. You accumulate points just for purchasing. A nice place to get CD's, DVD's, and even VHS.
",others
1730,"Zia's is pretty much the equivalent of Newbury Comics, the record store I frequented most back home in Boston.  Now that I've moved out here, it was nice to find something so similar.  re: Chris R.- True, a lot of people are done with CDs due to the changes in the music industry over the years.  But for a lot of people, you can't replace the experience of browsing a huge selection of artists at a place like this.I'll go here and spend an hour or so until i have a stack of like 6 or 7 CDs, then narrow it down to the best 3 or 4 finds to buy that day.  I've gotten a lot of good deals here and always enjoy myself.  Staff is great.

ZIA is the best place to get the latest art, independent,foreign and new releases on DVD at a great price even if they are used, I have never had a single problem with ANY of the used DVD's I have purchased there. The CD collection is awesome and they usually have hard to find releases that places like Best Buy and Borders dont carry. Some other reviewer said he can get all these things for the same price on Ebay, but who wants to wait for their stuff to come in the mail and spend money on shipping and ending up with scratched materialZIA is the place to be!

Anyway, I remember the first CD I ever bought was Sheena Easton's first and self titled CD. I was so excited that I played that CD over and over. I still feel the same way when I purchase a CD. More so when I purchase a CD at a record store and at a bargain. I love to browse around and listen to the staff's current faves and the recommended new artists at the music listening stations. I have a huge shelves and shelves of CDs and i still get excited when I add another CD to the collection.

Really solid selection of vinyl records, genres include rock (biggest), r&b, hip-hop and electronic. There's a retro video games section where you can reminisce about your favorite NES cartridge. The DVD selection is ridiculously deep, especially in the tv section. Lots of cool books, gifts and a place where you can make your own t shirt.

They also take pre-orders on vinyl and new video games as well, and they video games are the exact same price as Lamestop anyway.The video game selection is amazing and always changing.They have new and used, vintage and modern cds and records for fair prices.They will also take store credit for cool use stuff, so you can trade old records and game for that new game you want if ya got the right stuff at the right time!People keep saying it's expensive, but i disagree. i believe the prices are very fair for their quality, and the cash goes right back into our local economy. i think most people don't understand the cost of local and niche goods. i used to work at a record store, and shipping vinyl is expensive! so if you are used to wal-mart prices, then go there.OH THATS RIGHT wal-mart doesnt carry ANY GOOD MUSIC, let alone support local musicians with events and sell their merch. gee, funny how that works.If you are a treasure hunter, i highly recommend this place.

1742,"Good things do still come in small packages.  If you find yourself in the Elizabeth neighborhood don't neglect to drop in here and check out their selection of new and used CDs and DVDs or just to browse their selection of music-related books, magazines and local news rags.  Park in the back behind the building!When I walked in it brought back memories of my beloved Reckless Records in Chicago.  And I knew I'd found my new sonic home in Charlotte.  It's flanked by a tattoo studio and a pawn shop and admittedly parking is a bit of a pain.  But it's worth the effort (both psychological and automotive) to get a gander at some premium stacks of used music.  If there's a more punk rock shop in this town drop me a line.

1745,"I can't stress enough how important it is to go into Lunchbox and browse around, especially if you have a hunger (like I do) for hearing the new, interesting and eclectic. The owner, Scott, has poured his heart and soul into giving music fanatics a place in the Charlotte metro where we can go and dick around, dig through the stacks, and find something new and exciting. Record stores like this are hard to come by, you're lucky if your city has one - I know I've seen many good independent record stores hang on and eventually close due to poor sales or community interest. From what I've gathered, Scott has a strong customer base (myself definitely included) and I hope that Lunchbox sticks around for a very long, long time.But enough soapboxing about the state of really good record stores, you want to know what you're going to find there. Ok. So.When your eyes adjust to dim but cozy lighting indoors, you'll probably have a few adjectives spring to mind:1) Small;2) Cluttered; and3) Vinyl.Ok, so Vinyl's not really an adjective in this context. But it's an integral part of what makes Lunchbox so great - Scott collects a wide range of records in every genre imaginable: rock, pop, electronic, jazz, rap, soul, dubstep, IDM, punk, noise, classical, avant-garde, alternative, spoken-word, metal, I don't think I really need to go on. If you want it, they probably have it. If they don't, Scott will order it. The vinyl racks line the walls from front to back and are jam-packed with 12""s, 10""s and 7""s. There's a crate of box sets in the back. There's overstock Record Store Day in the corner. There's a section of new arrivals used vinyl halfway down the left wall and there's a decent stock of used records that you can dig through to your heart's content. The middle section of the store is CD racks - a strong selection of the afore mentioned genres and a decent selection of used CDs as well. It's not a huge used section and it's definitely an eclectic mix - if you're in for a really big used music selection, you should probably check out Manifest - but the stuff I do find there is well worth the time.Prices are really quite good for what you get, especially on the new music. Scott's goal is to sell just enough over cost to make it worthwhile. There's no crazy $6.99 Best-Buy-esque specials on new music but he is able to put some reduced price stuff up from time to time. Your standard-issue CD is going to cost $10-15. Vinyl prices are (as usual) slightly higher than CDs but generally range $15-20 for most releases.What really clinches the deal for me is Scott and his staff - they are great people, they know their stuff, and Scott has never once told me that an album is great just because he wants to sell it. Scott has led me to some absolutely incredible finds and I trust him completely on knowing something new and interesting for me to check out.So please, to get back up on the box, please visit Lunchbox whenever you want to hear something new. Buy it, don't download it, support your local record store and don't be afraid to hear something new. Lunchbox is another absolutely integral piece of the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood, and I'll be distraught if it ever goes away.

1746,"Most people will tell you that vinyl gives a much warmer sound than anything digital - be it CDs or downloaded music.  That may or may not be true.  There are, however, problems with vinyl.The first is that vinyl is a royal pain to keep clean.  Remove an LP from its sleeve, whether it is one you have only just opened or one that you have carefully cared for all of these years, and the chances that it will play all the way through without a single skip are at best 50-50.  Often much less.For most of us regular non-audiophiles, the sound is probably not worth the hassle of dealing with the headaches involved in getting the thing to play: Cleaning each and every side of every LP each time you want to play it, just to have a chance of hearing the whole record.  Setting (and resetting) the stylus.  Removing the record sleeve, then the record.  Reversing the process.  CDs are so much easier, to say nothing of digitized music.Is it better  Very likely.  But is it worth it  That is up to you to decide.Once you have decided that you need some vinyl, there are only so many options left.  In Charlotte, Lunchbox is a great place to go to pick up some old records on the cheap.  I mean really cheap.  In many cases, just a dollar or two for the bargain bin.  Maybe five bucks for something better.  Of course, this is for old releases.  Newer stuff will set you back a bit more (and yes, new content is coming out on vinyl).You can even pick up turntables, both new and used, at Lunchbox, both the traditional kind and the USB sort in case you want to transfer your existing LP collection onto your computer so you never have to deal with those records again.  Note that this process is not simple, but it can be done.Naturally, the problems with vinyl cannot be attributed to Lunchbox - that is inherent in the media.  But if you have decided to make the jump, this is the place to go if you need help, or just want to explore and see if it is for you.  Definitely a resource to have on your list.

1747,"i have found some of my most prized vinyl at lunchbox. they don't carry crap. it seems like a rule. everything on the display is good and on my wish list. they know their demographic! the staff still can seem a bit... judge-y I have been self conscious about my picks before... even though i thought they were awesome. BUT, if you are lucky enough to get the nod of approval, or even a ""great album""... you will feel like you could be head music editor of Rolling Stone. Your self worth shoots through the roof. so maybe it is good that they don't hand those head-nods out like candy. (i got the head nod with Morrisey's ""Viva Hate"" and Bob Dylan's ""The Free wheelin' Bob Dylan""...make note.)

They keep shoppers updated on their newly received new and used records via Twitter and Facebook status which helps to know what is in stock.  This alone keeps them at a higher rating than other record stores in CLT.

1750,"After discovering Lunchbox by my work i have become a weekly visitor it seems. I haven't been into vinyl long but this is the best shop in Charlotte, mainly because of the awesome New selection. Sure Manifest has a massive used section, which is great but their new stuff is nothing compared to tiny Lunchbox. Also a great place to learn about new music too.

This is a popular place!This is my new Favorite place to shop for MusicDVDs and LOOK, which means I'm more than a fan of the patrons here!  In a popular shop this size it is easy to be inspired in very appropriate ways.  If you like what is in here there is a good chance you could meet someone who has similar taste... Enough about dating!They still have bands doing shows here too!  Small Live Music Venue... Very Cool!   For the size of the store they have a GIGANTIC Punk section and even for a store much larger they have a Huge Punk section.  After being here a little while it was easy to understand they only sell the cool Movies and Music.  I found more that I liked here than in several stores combined!  This time I found two DVDs that I thought I may not be able to find so easily and for only $4.00 each, one French and one Thai.  I felt more than lucky, more like Fortunate!

1752,"Ear Wax is THE place to go for buying metal in Madison.  They have a huge selection that spans all sub-genres, definitely with an emphasis on the more extreme sub-genres.  They also have quite a bit of punk, psychobilly, and ambient, although the focus is really on metal.  They also have a good selection of merch (shirts, patches, etc.) although I found the t-shirt selection to be a little skimpy as a person who prefers plain logo T's as opposed to shirts with tons of art on them.  Also, most of the shirts are XL.Ear Wax also has a decent selection of vinyl, DVD's and 'zines, although I've never really checked them out.  The focus is really on CD's.If you are a ""casual"" metal fan who thinks that Slipknot and Trivium are the best the genre has to offer, you will be overwhelmed (and possibly intimidated) upon walking in.  If you aren't a metal fan at all, you won't find anything of interest unless you want a Cannibal Corpse t-shirt for irony purposes.  If you're a die-hard metal fanatic, however, this store is right up your alley.  Every time I go in there I have a hard time limiting myself to only a few purchases because there is so much that catches my eye.  Just about every big metal band is represented, along with a whole bunch that I've never heard of.The price is right (usually around $12 for a CD, $7 used) and the selection is unbeatable.  If you love extreme music, you can't pass up the chance to visit this awesome store.

It is actually a park for the city and there is a lot of history behind the actual site itself.The flowers are very nice and they have roses obviously but also lots of other flowers and trees as well.  The center of the yard has an old coal car from when the railroad used to be in service.Parking is easy with a gravel lot right out front.

I love going here, and I do wish my backyard looked like this.Unfortunately for me, I brought a minor with me.  Minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal, but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies.  Most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings, but butterflies  It's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.If you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  I thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and ""trust"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman andor my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!Minor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.But other than that, this is a lovely place when we are not there.  Thank you and goodnight.

But even in the summer, it's a nice city escape. Just wear a hat & sunscreen and try to go first thing in the morning. There are drinking fountains around every turn and plenty of shade. Try a guided tour if you have the time or are playing host to out-of-town guests. The guides are friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Even if you've lived in AZ all your life (like me) you are bound to learn something new.

We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddingsreceptions (who could blame these people) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.

1775,"I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too ""perfect"" to be of much interest. And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, ""wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist."" They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.This place never grows old. It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here.

At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.

Who knew there were so many different types of cactus  Its really interesting to see them all and learn about their place within the desert ecosystem.   You feel as if you are transported to a world many miles away from Phoenix (just move the telescope a little if a building gets in your line of sight) and its a perfect place to bring an out of town guest as I am positive they have nothing like it where they are from.The seasonal butterfly exhibit is fantastic, it reminded me of my third grade classroom where we had Monarch butterflies just flying around.  (My teacher was a little bit of a hippie)  It doesn't have to take up a whole day if you don't want it to and you can explore at your own pace.  Come spring time I'm sure that the wildflower portion is beautiful.  I'm very excited to go back for the Las Noches de las Luminarias.

1786,"Phipps Conservatory is another one of the many outstanding cultural amenities in Pittsburgh.  I wonder if my fellow natives realize the wealth of culture this city has.Anyway, I took a week's worth of annual leave from work and decided to make the must of our cultural institutions.  So I asked my friend Marla, a stay-at-home mom if she'd like to join me here for a day.  Marla practically dialed her mother to ask her to babysit even before I was done talking to her!One thing I like is that if you only have a little bit of time, you can visit the Sustainable Perennial Gardens, right around the dome of the Phipps.  I believe that you can visit this part for free.  But the Sustainable Perennial Gardens shows you how you can plant flowers and plants that require little water, fertilizer, and pesticides.It would be too hard for me to list all of the rooms that Phipps has.  I guess my favorite is the Fern Room, which has a lot of prehistoric plants and tree ferns, many of which have been around since the time of the dinosaurs.  I also enjoy the Tropical Fruit Spice Room and the Tropical Forest Conservatory.  It is in these rooms that we are reminded of one of the reasons that the rainforests are so so important to us.  Not only is the biodiversity so great, but we get so many of our fruits and spices from them.  Take a moment to deeply inhale this fragrant room!  We also get so many medicines from the rainforest and this place has a research lab and a ""Healer's Hut"".Marla's favorite exhibits are the Desert Room and the Japanese Courtyard Garden.  I can see her point.  Japanese gardens are intended to be places of tranquility.  The Phipps also has a huge outdoor garden and I'm glad that we had the nice weather last week.  It gave us one last chance to walk through the walkways and the beautiful fountains before they're closed for the winter.Oh, and we saw this guest speaker http:www.youtube.comwatchv=o7Ixe95CZOE  I'M JUST KIDDING!

There are so many different varieties and I love to be able to see them up close and marvel at their beauty. I also love the Tropical Forest Conservatory. It's so peaceful and tranquil.

I don't know how people do it so well, but whoever it is that the hotel hires each year to omit just the right amount of ""holiday fragrance"" into the air, both in the hotel and the conservatory, does an excellent job. This year, the air was filled with notes of vanilla and cinnamon.  Last yeat, it was more pine.  Anyways, this was the firs time I was able to take my mother to see the conservatory.  The first piece that we looked at was a huge reindeer covered in pecans and adorned with all other types of flowers, roses, greenery, and even some dried flowers.  Water was creating the illusion of canopy type wiring that would be used to attach flowers and things.  it's hard to explain.  there was a little water show going on in one of the exhibits.  there were so many beautiful pointsettas and even some more interesting, moving pieces to the displays. in one of them were several penguins in what was an adorable arctic scene.  it was too cute. you had to see it yourself. anyway, it was very fun to see all of this going on. i love that it's open 247 and that it's such an elaborate display. i'm a fan of this conservatory. you should check it out if you've never seen it before!! it is definitely a sight to see.

This time, Fall flowers, pumpkins, waterfall trees, and large animated forest creatures filled the space. It's the perfect place to stop and just enjoy something in Vegas that has nothing to do with drinking or gambling. Plus, there's tons of background for photo ops. The only downside It gets crowded, of course.

1794,"The Conservatory at the Bellagio was beautiful when I visited in November 2008.  Since it was the fall, the conservatory had an autumn theme with wood nymphs and fall flowers and pumpkins.  It presents the perfect photo op for tourists and thus can be quite crowded.  Around the corner is the patisserie where you can buy some gelato or a crepe and return to peruse the conservatory.

1795,"Living plants and fauna inside a casino.  It is awesome.  Just WILD... and I want to know what they do to protect the poor trees from the tourists, smoke, and awful, awful Chihuly shops.  What a hack.Okay the chocolate stand around the corner with the huge chocolate waterfall was... well... I couldn't stop saying ""Augustus!!!""The christmas decorations make it quite quaint, and the little walkway that had tourists marching alongside Nutcracker replicas 14' tall.  They looked like cows marching to the abattoir, plus the snowmen, etc was incredibly festive.Lovely.Not sure if it hit me right, frankly.Anyhoo... I have seen the room at day and night with and without the consumer driving holiday stimulus (people see ornaments and freak out and need to shop).....I like it.  A LOT.  It is living earthy grooviness inside a terrible naughty casino (which can also be nice).So... visit it.  IT IS THE ONLY FREE THING IN VEGAS.  Besides dudes who click cards with their fingers for stripshows.Those guys *ARE* Vegas.

1797,"You could theoretically walk through it without realizing you're walking through it.  The Bellagio as a whole is so oppulently decorated that you may just figure you've wandered into a particularly plant-filled section and pay it no mind.Rest assured, you're in an actual Conservatory.  That's managed, pruned, and decorated.  Great for pictures, decorated for holidays and a generally pleasant distraction from the smoky casino floor.

1798,"Beautiful! The Bellagio Conservatory is a must see for anyone visiting Vegas. As a Hawaii resident, LAS is a home away from home for island folks. We stopped by in Nov 2008 to take in the fall displays. Amazing use of natural products. It was a nice way to kick-off the holiday season.

1800,"This is a truly amazing oasis in a sea of cheese and debauchery.  Since we were sans little wee one on our naughty adult vacation to Sin City, we decided to pop over to the Springs Preserve and check it out.  It's a relatively new desert botanical garden and learning center.  Hubby is a science teacher so he was WAY excited to get his science groove on.We went a little later than expected and only had a couple hours to spend but we easily could have spent at least 4 hours wandering the hiking trails and checking out the cool exhibits.  Basically this attraction has three parts...origin experience which has tons of cool interactive activities, films, and a little zoo of desert life, Desert Lving Center which is all about conservation, and GardensTrails which is a bunch of interconnected trails.  It was really cold when we were there so we didn't spend as much time as we like on the trails.If you have some time and want to get away for a bit from the smoke and vice of the Strip, check out the Springs Preserve. It's really lovely.

1801,"Only a few blocks from my apartment, I expected this place to be out in the middle of nowhere or on the edge of town.  Today was the one-year anniversary of Spring's Preserve, so I treated my roommate, my son and I to attend the event (the fact that it cost $6 each instead of $14.95 was a major reason why I was so nice).  While the crowds were outrageous today, it did not detract from what the Preserve has to offer overall.There are many different facets of this huge campus, from the OriGEN experience to the gardens on the outskirts of the property; each has something great to show and tell you.  We started in the gardens, examining the flora and fauna that is prevalant in this area.  We were shown various ways to create a garden using plants that are meant to be here as well as planting veggies and fruits in new and interesting ways, something I did not think could be done well around here.We ventured further into the Preserve and found the ampitheater where a free ice-cream social was coinciding with live Celtic and eventually Blues musicians performing.  What a great place this would be for a night of music and some food or drinks.  We were told that the next week on Father's day there would be a BBQ, Blues and Beer festival where the first 100 dad's got in for free.  Events like this are an excellent way to attract positive attention to such a wonderful place.Past the ampitheater is the OriGEN building where there are a multitude of displays that are interactive and interesting.  Educational video games occupy one room while a history of the area display with live actors playing a turn-of-the-century train ride scene are in another.  Beyond this room lies one of the most exciting parts of the experience: the Flash Flood room.  Only 30 people can go in at a time, so expect a line.  Standing on a platform at the bottom of a mock wash, you experience what it is like to be in the middle of a flash flood.  My son was in the front row and he came out a little wet.Further along you will find a great insect, reptile and mammal display that has many interesting specimens.  We found that a few of the animals were dead, however, but this is not to be unexpected.  One was a kangaroo mouse that was hidden away in his burrow (he may have been sleeping but we doubt it.  The lizards were very excited to have visitors as you may see in one of the pictures I posted of the Preserve.Expect to spend at least 2-3 hours here.  A lot of the activities are outside, so apply sunscreen.  Water fountains are every where and most are very cold (moreso near the buildings).  We did not go into the main building where the gift shops and restaurants were, but refer to other reviews as other yelper's have visited them.  I will update when I return here again.

1804,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. How can you not enjoy the center of where Las Vegas started. The best part about this place is the Wolfgang Puck balcony cafe where we get our favorite Kobe Burger and Fries. I think it's the best in Vegas. Juicy medium burger. The tender buttery meat really melts in your mouth. The fries are long and crisp when you bite into them. Very Gourmet.  Come here for July 4th and watch the scattered fireworks along the 10 mile strip with the Las Vegas Philharmonic playing in the background. You can definitely find us here at least once a month.

For families in Hawaii, there is the usual, ""you-can-never-go-wrong-with"" Waikiki Zoo or Waikiki Aquarium, etc. to frequent, at least a million times in your lifetime (or your kids' lifetimes).Here in Las Vegas, the place to take the family is the Springs Preserve!  Heck!  Better yet!  Get an annual membership there!  You will never tire of the place!  The place is packed with so much to do!  The Springs Preserve is not your typical museum.  In a nutshell, it is a cultural institute of Las Vegas' history and its move towards a promising future of sustainability with all its natural resources that is available in Las Vegas.Who said that learning is not fun!  There is so much to learn about Las Vegas and you can find it here.  The one thing I, as well as my 8-year old son, have learned about the most, for instance, is the creation and history of the aquifers in the valley.  Yes, you heard that right.  There is water in this here desert!From classes and workshops to events and concerts, the Springs Preserve offers a wealth of information - and they do it in such a fun and natural way!  What we like best of all are the live desert animal exhibits to view, the gardens to stroll through and trails to walk, and the kids' playground area to rest and relax in.  And when it's time to grab a bite, you can't go wrong with the Springs Cafe By Wolfgang Puck.We just renewed our annual membership which, for families, is $60, basic value package, or $25 for individuals.  We were just there last night for the Haunted Harvest, a festival of games, trick or treatin', performances and fun!  They even had a haunted maze!

The Biodome is one of Montreal's ""must sees"". If you're visiting, just go. If you're lucky enough to live here (and sometimes I need a reminder about that) go and take in the experience, and then start thinking of your return trip.

The rainforest is really really hot, the bat exhibit was cool (and scary) and the penguins were delightful. I loved how the birds could all fly and that it actually rained in parts of the dome.

A wave of humidity hit me and my surroundings all of a sudden became lush and green. I was stunned by the birds and butterflies that roamed freely throughout the small conservatory. It was an awesome feeling and there's nothing else like it! If you're still enough, the butterflies will obliviously land on you. There's an area where the butterfly chrysalises hang and, if you're lucky, you'll even see butterflies emerging from their slumber.

1820,"There is something special about being able to step into a building from a busy, bustling and noisy city center - and be transported to a quiet, alive and organic rainforest of plants, trees and flowers.The Royal Botanic Garden is one such way that you can experience this feeling - the gardens, located in the city center are huge, spread out across a massive piece of land, and both indoors in a huge green house, and out in the gardens outside. The Garden is particularly pleasent in the summer, where the sun shines, the flowers bloom and generally you will feel one with nature. There is nothing better than spending a lazy day here, just wandering about admiring the plants and watching the world go by.

1821,"I have mentioned in previous reviews than I am very green fingered indeed, I just love foliage, so Royal Botanic Gardens was always going to be a winner in my book. Established in 1670 the Royal Botanic Gardens is very lush indeed and up there with the finest display of shrubbery in the world. Picture perfect on a summer's day when all the flowers are in bloom. It is absolutely free to enter and did you know that the largest palm tree in any greenhouse in Britain is housed right here That was your useless fact of the day. In addition to this there's also the famous rock garden and an award winning collection of rhododendrons.

It's a wonderful way to spend a sunny day, and far more civilised and tranquil than the cider-swilling meadows.At a B&B in Oban I once saw some prizewinning rhododendrons, and the bad boys on show in here are the first I've seen that could compete with the finest the rural West Coast has to offer. So full of wonderful purple colour they actually stain the surrounding leaves.Now that's proper horticulture for you.

From it's Palm houses to Inverleith House at the heart of the Gardens, every acre is filled with peace and tranquility in the middle of this metropolis. I now take my kids to the Gardens and to see them feed the squirrels and pigeons and to tumble and rush through the fallen leaves in Autumn as I used to do myself is priceless.

However, even if you go in the Winter, the greenhouses are kept at really humid conditions allowing all types of plants to prosper as well as giving you somewhere nice and warm to go in the cold months!The gardens are well kept and are very clean and there is a cafe towards the middle of the area if you want to stop for a cup of coffee and a snack. The grounds are also very easy to navigate around due to an abundance of signs and maps.

Outstandingly beautiful and peaceful with an attractive array of wildlife, including some very friendly squirrels who will eat out of your hand if you're patient enough - though be warned they will bite if they feel threatened.There is a restaurant on the grounds which is ridiculously overpriced and a not inexpensive shop, but the shop is good for souvenirs and if you take a picnic with you there are plenty of places you can enjoy it.  The arboretum is spectacular, though not cheap, but you don't need to visit it to enjoy the gardens and entrance is free.My favourite part has to be the Chinese garden with its bamboo and waterfalls, though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and you can easily spend an entire day out there.  Not to be missed.

1827,"This place was absolutely incredible.  I visited in late March, but it seems to be the kind of place that has a different style of beauty at different points.  I'll talk about my two favorite parts: the greenhouse gardens and the general gardens (specifically the 'rock hill garden')Walking into each greenhouse was like discovering a whole new world.  Ranging from tropical rooms covered in brilliant flowers and lush vines to a desert room with cactus.  My only regret is that I wasn't able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid.  I have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10.  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids (which are awesome) and 10 had an Amorphophallus Titanum, a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower. Unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth, but that's just an incentive to come back :)The rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play.  While I was there, a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time.  If you have kids, take them here, they will love it.  From the top of the hill, you can see the Edinburgh skyline, complete with castle. Trust me its worth seeing.

1828,"Bit too many rhododendrons for me. But - am I going to knock a star off what is a lovely tranquil space to spend a day Not I, said the fly. I haven't visited RBGE since I was kneehigh to a lawnmower, when we went to the glasshouses to learn about the rainforest and the threat to it's existence (how times have changed, eh eh) and tried dried mango for the first time. Roll on twenty-something years, and it's taken into our heads to revisit. And it really hasn't changed in any way. It's still beautiful, although I swear it was all indoors the last time I visited! Honest! For the tourist wanting to do something not directly on the main drag, or the local wanting somewhere pleasant to picnic in the town, you can't really go wrong. Enjoy.

I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (""the rest"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)My only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!!

I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here.The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty!

1833,"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, but who cares The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!

1836,"Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review 100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.After reading everyone else's reviews, I hope to come back here next for brunch.**to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail!

1838,"I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. My most recent trip was with my wife on 11510. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream  cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative.

1840,"Quite a number of the best meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at Blue. Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed, and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.The staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high level of respect, and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no problem from the scheduler. Don't forget, if you bring your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue, because they have a wine list that is second to none (well, maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.It's hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get, and an emphasis on great sauces. Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.The cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra. Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.Be sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites!

1841,"The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty.

1842,"I have been here twice, both times with a large group & we had a private room.  Service was excellent as was the food.  I always recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte & they always tell me how much they loved it.

1843,"I like Blue, not sure why I don't get here too often (the price may be a big weigher).Last time I was here is for a friend's birthday celebration. I ordered the sea bass and yum... I almost lick my plate if only my momma didn't teach me well. My companions got Moroccan chicken and some part of pig on a bone. Yes, they both are also yummy (I'm a forker and good at it!) But definitely glad I didn't lick my plate because then I had room for dessert. They were nice enough to put all three desserts (chocolate moose, lemon bar and chocolate molten cake) on a beautiful plate with candle on it. We unanimously agreed, we will claw each other for the lemon bar. Waitress was really nice and attentive. So... definitely come and visit blue, get some wine and lemon bar while listening to jazz.

1845,"My wife and I goto Blue several times a year (mostly for special occasions and what not.)They've never put a foot wrong.The service is impeccable, the wine list is extensive, the martinis delicious, the food delectable.My absolute favorite has to be the summer seasonal Pork Milanese.  Had the Tenderloin last time and was suitably sated.
",others
1846,"So I have eaten here a hand full of times and the food and service has always been out of this world. This is actually one of my favorite places to get fillet Mignon. Although, I have tried many other things on the menu though; like the wild boar - which will blow your mind. Regardless, I think you would be hard pressed to find bad food here. The only disappointment I have ever experienced with this place is that they serve Foie Gras. I am sure they make what is considered ""good foie gras"" but I just think it is cruel in terms of what they have to do to the poor duckgoose to make this dish. As far as the feel of the place, although it is upscale, I find it to be a bit more casual than formal. With low light and deep tranquil colors, it is relaxing; setting a good stage for conversation. Another great date place in my book!
",others
1847,"I've been to Blue twice to entertain clients for dinner and both times, the restaurant exceeded my expectations!  First, they are extremely accomodating to large groups and easy to make reservations with.  The staff is top notch with impeccable service and I was very pleased to see that they knew the extensive wine list and every detail of the menu to a tee, which should be a given at a restaurant of this caliber but I'm always surprised at how many places this doesn't hold true.  Onto the food, we started with the arancini (sp) balls - YUM, they are a must have and our table enjoyed the calamari and scallops as well.  For dinner, several people at our table had the Wild Boar (two ways), which I got to taste, and it was amazing, definitely one of the best things on the menu.  I opted for the Duck Bolognese the first time and was not disappointed; the sauce, pasta, duck and even the fried egg on top were all cooked perfectly with flavors that blended exceptionally well.  During my most recent visit, I had the Lamb Tagine, which was not only spectacular in presentation but also in flavor.  It's a hefty portioncooked over cous cous with fruits and veggies - it was so tender is just slid off the bone.  To finish, all the desserts were great and I highly recommend Blue for just about anything - a date, business dinner, special occasion or just a drink at the bar.  Enjoy!
",others
1848,"I took my husband to Blue last week to celebrate his birthday and we both loved it!  The waiter we had was very helpful and proceeded to give us a list of his favorite menu items as soon as we sat down.  His input deemed extremely useful since my husband loved the dish he recommended.We decided to order the cheese platter and were very pleased with it.  Although the cheese that the waiter described as ""stinky cheese"" was pretty mild, it was still pretty flavorful.  The lamb shank that I ordered was cooked perfectly. In fact, it was so perfect that the meat was falling off the bone!  As a disclaimer, I will start by saying that I don't eat pork (I know, I know) but the pork shoulder that my husband ordered was phenomenal!  The risotto that comes with the dish was also fantastic.  It was simple yet very flavorful.The only complaint that I have about this restaurant is its dessert.  We ordered the cake di chocolate and were terribly disappointed by it.  This chocolate cake just falls short.  If you decide to try a dessert at this restaurant, I would definitely recommend that you try something else (especially is you love chocolate).
",others
1849,"LOVED LOVED LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's kind of like a cafe style restaurant with a glass cheese display.  The owner is a humble Republican State Senator...after a few glasses of wine he probably gets cornered quite a bit.  Anyway...I was on a date.  This is a GREAT date place.  We ordered pairings of cheeses and wines that are already selected for you.  We each got our own tastes (3 each).  We shared each other's cheese and wine.  The service is so so, but nothing to complain about really.  After our cheese tasting I ordered the salmon.  It was cooked very well with fresh vegetables.Great place...and I look forward to my next visit in Phoenix to come back here.
",others
1850,"Out of all the wine bars I've been to in the Phoenix area (not counting Divine Wine in Mesa), this is my favorite! Hands down. The people are friendly, the room is spacious, the wine selection is supple & the atmosphere is cozy. The last time I went was after dinner at Panino on Central. My date and I went into the wine bar to sample a selection. He chose his with cheese. I did not. My wine was incredible. We were able to relax on the couch, continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips. I was giddy with pleasure. To top it off, the bathroom is unisex... and sneaky. Behind a wall without a handle, you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way. While waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside), a couple men profusely apologized. Evidently, they thought they were in the wrong bathroom. Little did they know. I would go back here in a heartbeat. In fact, I've been thinking of going soon - it's a perfect place for a date, since there's plenty of room to sit and an atmosphere conducive to conversation. Forget Kaz. Try Cheuvoront instead.

1851,"Amazing food, great presentation and sleek space - with NO WAIT on a Saturday night!  Huh  Yes, you read that right.  After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.Atmosphere - 5 starsFood - 4.75 starsService - 3.75 starsOverall - 4.5 starsThis is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, ehOur main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.
",others
1852,"Sigh.  I'm in love.  If only I lived closer to Cheuvront.  Maybe I'll move downtown just to be closer....My husband and I went in on a Saturday night for a few glasses of wine.  Once we saw the desserts, however, we knew we had to try it!  I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was very good (it wasn't the Harvard Faculty Club, but then again...what is) and my husband selected the coconut pie.  Both servings were huge and covered in whipped cream.  They were fantastic.  Finally, a place to go for dessert here!We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was amazing.  He offered us complimentary tastings of two delicious dessert wines and then even offered us a complimentary mini cheese sampler with an amazing sheep's milk cheese.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was laid back, kind of cafebistro-ish but still modern.  They were playing The Food Network which I absolutely loved...I've never seen that in a restaurant before! It was a great touch.   The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.They have a wonderful wine dinner with four courses for only $55 a person!  I'm eager to attend one in the future and I definitely plan on going back for dinner in the near future.And that folks, was my 400th review. :)

1853,"The search is over...I have found my favorite wine bar in the Valley! Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the ""wine by the glass"" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.Cheuvront is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or just to sit at the bar and try a new wine or two.  I know I will be there in the future especially with Kristin S. moving so close to it!

1854,"As far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has Postino's beat by a long shot.  The wine list is impressive.  The staff can make recommendations on the fly.  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines.  The food is out of this world - but unpretentious.   You don't have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront.   With that said - try the Macaroni and Cheese - which is what I tried tonight - out of this world, albeit a little spicy.  I've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because I'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine.  My new favorite!

1855,"Oh dear god, I'm in love...Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini what shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me. If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke.

We haven't had a bad glass or bottle yet.  My wife likes to order their Cherry Lemon Drop Martini and I have to admit I enjoy it too.The food is always prepared with care and I've always enjoyed a cheese plate or a Flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairings.I would like to extend my kudos to Barry.  He is the reason I kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level.

1859,"Having grown up in a city with a large traditional Italian neighborhood, full of large traditional Italian restaurants, the first thing I tried to find in Phoenix was a good plate of tortellini and a decent piece of Veal Genovese.  I found them at Christos.The atmosphere at Christos is very traditional... white tablecloth, stemware, cloth napkin and flower centerpieces.  It feels special when you come here for a meal, but the meal is very reasonably priced.The menu is traditional, with dishes like Pasta Primavera, Linguine with Clam Sauce, Chicken or Veal Saltimbucca, Canneloni, Chicken, eggplant or Veal Parmigiana.  They have Cioppino, decent salads and a good wine list.  What more could you ask for

1860,"I have to say,I have been going to this ristorante for the past twenty years with my family.  Every time we go there we have the same server.  We are always greeted well and the alfredo is amazing, and so is the sea bass,  the halibut, and  veal chop.  The homemade house salad dressing is one of a kind too.  The new bar lounge area is nice and the pianist is a nice touch.  Love Christo's.
",others
1861,"It is not too often I am overly impressed. However, Christo's did just that yesterday when I had lunch there.My boss decided to take me and 2 of my coworkers to lunch for my birthday. He (my boss) really had some making up to do since last year he got me a 50 cent crappy brownie and put a candle in it and sang me happy birthday. He was definitely in the dog house. So I knew this year he was going to bring his A-game...hopefully. His choice is restaurants leaves a bit to be desired. Of course I did some research and Christo's appeared to be OK. So I felt a little at ease this time.I get there early and wait for my party. The hostess is very nice and she knows many of the people that are coming in as they are regulars. I have not seen anything like this since leaving home (NYC). Old world charm restaurants where they know you and you know them. I can't believe it. I grew up around very good Italian food. I have been to a few places here that Italians have recommended and it was just not up to par. Now mind you none of these Italians were east coast Italians. It is something to be said of Italian food on the East Cost.My party finally comes and we are seated. The place is very nice with the traditional white table cloths. Our server comes over and he is happy and attentive. He gets our drinks and comes back to take our appetizer order. We get the calamari of course. OMG the best I have ever had. It was lightly breaded and the marinara sauce was great. It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing. Our server comes back to tell us about the specials which btw were all fish dishes. I went with the red snapper, mussels, linguine with marinara and capers. Nobody ordered the same thing which is great cause that means we can share. The salads come out first and they are pretty basic. But the dressing was great. Ohh the bread was amazing. Jeez it is so hard to stop eating bread and butter. I was trying to save room for the rest of the meal. Our food comes out at the perfect time. Our fantastic server sets our plates out but before he gets to my co-workers plate this guy comes out and grabs his plate then brings it back in a matter of seconds. I thought wow the cook does not want stuff coming out the kitchen unless it is perfect. Come to find out it was Christo himself that came out to fix my co-workers dish. Looking around at the other plates I am thinking wow everything looks so amazing. The other thing is the portions were right on. I hate going to places and the have so much food it is ridiculous. The linguine was cooked perfectly. The server came over with extra cheese and of course a must have for me fresh cracked pepper. It was one of those times I did not want to share anything with anyone at the table. I did not want to disturb my palate from the wonderful flavors of my dish. I was thinking everyone else was thinking the same thing because no one was sharing. Well shortly after, every plate on that table was completely cleaned. The server was on point with filling our drinks. I never had a glass that was less than half full. Also I have waited tables and it is a fine line between being a pest and being helpful and friendly. Lets just say the servers at Christo's have this down perfectly. Well the plates are cleaned up and out comes this cute little cup of vanilla and chocolate mousse with a candle in it. Compliments of the kitchen since it is my b-day. Well is was great. I am not really into mousse because it is a texture thing but the flavor was awesome. I still got to order dessert. I got the flan, others had key lime pie and NY cheesecake. Ohh decisions a toss between cheese cake and flan. Well flan won. I practically licked the caramel sauce off the bottom of the plate. It was the best I have had here. Ohh NYC Christo's has brought a little of you back to me. Sniff Sniff tears of joy. I am so happy. I found a fantastic Italian restaurant.

1862,"O.k. let me get it right out there. This fabulous local spot in the same strip center as my own business. But after years of eating here I am not sure why they fly so far under the radar with the ""foodie"" crowd. The service is top notch (and ya know I'm a picky girl about this). Some of the servers have been there since the place opened.It is family owned and operated and they insist on high quality ingredients. The prices are fair and the portions are large. I am a huge fish fan and these guys  deliver up some amazingly well prepared Mediterranean style fish dishes. They serve soup and salad with their entrees and the bread is worth the splurge.I enjoy their wine selection and this summer there is a great wine special Mondays through Thursdays. I invite all my foodie friends to give it a try!

1864,"I usually reserve five stars for places like Kai, but for the price, this restaurant deserves five stars.  This is an excellent restaurant, and that is definitely rare in Phoenix.  We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine while waiting for another couple to arrive, and we were never rushed or made to feel like we were a bother because we didn't order any food for the first 45 minutes.The sea bass special was some of the moistest fish I have ever eaten.  I am amazed at how they were able to cook such a thick cut perfectly--not one part was over- or under-done.  It was served on a bed of pasta and topped with a marinara sauce that was delicious.  The entire dining experience was very pleasant.  No complaints.

1865,"Some friends turned me on to this restaurant years ago, and while I have since left AZ, they still live there, go to this restaurant, and still love the consistently GREAT food.  This was one of my favorite restaurants when I lived there.  They made perhaps the BEST cannelloni (melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness) and avgolemeno soup (only rival I've found is Taverna Tony in Malibu).  In fact, we had them cater my daughter's bat mitzvah reception......they were that good.  I'm just sad I haven't been able to enjoy their food since leaving AZ.  In addition to ALWAYS getting their cannelloni and avgolemeno soup, I used to get their Lemon Dill Salmon, Chicken Limone, Chicken Genovese, or Shrimp Scampi.

And they should be -- it's great!  They even have each pickle wedge individually wrapped in foil -- take as many as you want (within reason).   :-)I've been a customer of the Duck since long before most of you moved to Phoenix.

1874,"I love visiting D & D. This place is about the atmosphere as well as the food. On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch. On the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.I love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years. This is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!

1875,"Duck and Decanter is one of those places where while eating your meal, you suddenly think, ""Wait. Am I still in Phoenix"" This place is SO unlike anything else in midtown Phoenix that going there for the atmosphere is half the pleasure. It's part sandwich shop, part eclectic boutique, part wine cellar, part loft. And some other things thrown in too. Tucked away in a corner of a generic strip mall the place looks like someone's house from the 70's. Hard to describe. Once you enter there is a counter where you place your order with a little salad case, a cheese case, and a dessert case. Once you get your sandwich (or salad), you can either sit outside on the patio or take the stairs up to the upper dining area. Or sit on the upper deck outside patio. And yeah, the sandwiches can get a bit pricey but like I said, half the fun of the place is the atmosphere. I've always enjoyed my sandwich. It's not like I'm paying for something I don't like. The breads and the 'fixin's' have always been fresh and full of flavor. Go get a sandwich, do a little browsing, relax, and take in some people watching. And if you can figure out what city the place reminds you of, please let me know. Cause it's not Phoenix, for sure.

1876,"I love the Duck! My mom has taken me here for years growing up and I always loved their sammies and pickles. This last weekend a friend hosted a bridal shower for me on the patio and it was an amazing time.I didn't know you could reserve a private patio and it had the perfect mix of sun and shade. We had sammies and fruit salad catered and bought a few bottles of champagne. What else do you really need for a good timeWe ended up staying a little longer than our 3 hour reservation and never felt any pressure to hurry up or leave. We still heard the live music and got the energy of the other patrons while having our privacy.Food was tasty as always. Fresh veggies, hearty bread and I love that pine nuts are in the veggie.

As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.The Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.When I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, ""The reuben.""  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.Sitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.  But take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place.  Like the wine, there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it.

1878,"The BK Army had a meetup with our leader the lad we follow and the listen to every weeknight at 9pm on Channel 3. Oh wait, this suppose to be about the food, not Beverly Kidd. But she's so cute.Ok to the food. Its been about about two years since I have been to the The Duck and I have to say I really need to come back sooner next time. My usual fare is a roast beef or corned beef sandwich, but this time I wen for the duck sandwich. I can't believe that I waited this long to try out the signature meal. You get to choose what you want, a variety of cheese is accompanied by different mustards, mayo and of course the tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and of course almost every type of bread. What is probably the most fascinating is the assembly process. There are always at least five people assembling the orders, three taking orders or getting the orders to the customer. You order at one end, wait around a but and pick up on the other end. On between there are cookies, sauces, coffee pots and almost anything one could want to have a yummy meal. Then there is the stuff for the home kitchen or counter. So to the review the duck sandwich was amazing, going to have it again. Got mine on a croissant with a bit of mayo and mustard. Only got a half, with a beer. There is a small pub style corner with a smaller choice of beers. This didn't damper the meal at all. The place is always hopigng seems like. Seating upstairs overlooks the lower area, and the outside always seems to have a couple of four legged companions that are sometimes as humorous as the owners. The little fellas seem to know exactly how much they can annoy their larger counterparts. This is one nice deli, sandwich shop and gathering of just plain great folks. Oh yeah and Beverly Kidd was great fun to be with and eat with.. she also seemed to like the Chocolate Surprise cake I got for her.... opppss was that suppose to be kept quite

1879,"For some time, my idea of an absolutely perfect lunch was to go to vintage market, get a great salad, a plate of cheese and fruit and a bottle of wine.  On a great weather day, sitting outside and watching the people stroll by, there isn't much better.  Mind you, you can't do that often, but it's wonderful when you can.  It's the closest I've seen for feeling like you're sitting at a Paris market outside a busy street.  They have great sandwiches too.  And if you aren't in the mood for my ideal lunch fantasy, they can still help you pick out a great glass of wine to go with your sandwich before you run over to see a move at Esplanade.  Or, buy a whole bottle of wine to enjoy after the movie.  I've always been given great assistance in picking out the perfect bottle.  I can almost taste it now....

1880,"I've been driving past Sophie's for 3 years now and finally took the opportunity to go for happy hour. On Friday night they have half price bar appetizers and my husband and I split 3 dishes and were blown away!We ordered the escargot, which was very tender and delicious and had a very authentic, rich flavour. The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side. The most amazing dish we sampled was the Noisettes de boeuf, which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a Dijon mustard sauce. This was seriously the most amazing beef that I've ever had and I'm typically not a steak person. We ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that good!We finished off the night with a delectable Creme Brulee and it brought me back to my days living in France. It was the perfect ending to an incredible meal.The owner of the restaurant is extremely friendly and sat down at the bar to chat with us for a while. The bistro has a very warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio is beautiful at night. This place isn't snobby like a lot of French restaurants and the staff is very responsive.We ended up spending about $100 between the drinks and 4 appetizers (BTW - the Mango Martini is to die for!) but the whole experience was really worth it. Tuesday night is ladies night with half-price wine by the glass and I'll be back again soon for that.keywords: french food 85016, french cuisine, biltmore area french bistro, arcadia area french food

1883,"Sophie's in one word  Perfect.I only go twice a year to celebrate the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Why  Because I don't want it too become familiar or stale.  Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for and Sophie's doesn't disappoint.Dining is an experience.  You put on shined shoes and a tie and make reservations.  I like to go around 5:30 because it's usually not that busy.  The dining room is inviting, calming, welcoming.  You can have a conversation without having to raise your voice.  I always make it a point to try something way out of my comfort zone:Lobster Bisque -- the last thing I eat before I die! sweet breads (a.ka. brains) -- ethereal...gooey, runny cheese -- salty and tangypate (goose liver) -- creamy and so flavorfulThings I wouldnt' have eaten in a million years are some of the best things I have EVER eaten.  Sophie's just invites you to be daring.Do you wait for your food  Yes!  But that is the best part.  You can have a conversation with your date, you can relax.  They don't make you feel rushed so why should you take on the responsibility yourself  Just enjoy yourself.  The food is coming.So many places are so desperate to turn over tables that diners adopt the same mentality.  Gotta get my food fast, gotta eat it fast, gotta get out of here!  I love Sophie's because I can take the time to appreciate everything.  It is just so wonderful to find a place like that to look forward to every year.  It's worth the wait.

1884,"Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.Their happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. We topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note.

1885,"The owner Serge was very French, but his head chef was not. I loved that their head chef came from another culture. He had fallen in love with French food. So much so, he had moved to France to study it there. The dishes he created were perfectly delicous. I remember his filet with crushed peppercorns; it was soft and buttery. The peppercorns gave a kick without being overpowering. The quail was delicate and succulent. The salad with lavender honey vinaigrette was perfection. His chocolate spice cake was phenomenal. It contained seven spices. I can't begin to describe the joy that cake brought to everyone. It was unique. It was at the time when chocolate souffles were at every French restaurant. Unfortunately, he's not there anymore. Regardless, my rating will remain until I have a chance to go back and say otherwise.

1890,"I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves ""light fare.""  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!
",others
1891,"I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype. Happily, it did! The atmosphere, the food, and the wine all measure up at Postino, the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and Campbell.Postino is upscale, but not pretentious. The bruschetta really is out of this world, but the salads are incredible, too. Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd. I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable, even when the place was packed.

1892,"One of my favorite places in Phoenix, that I don't frequent nearly enough.  Great selection of wines by the glass.  The atmosphere is sexy, industrial pseudo-warehouse, I-don't-think-I'm-in-Phoenix type lounge.  I think on Tuesdays they have a live DJ in the mix.  It's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  The autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.UPDATE - Great service just recently.  A bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - Michelle I think, was one of them.  Just had a Tobin syrah that was incredible...

1894,"Located at the SW corner of 40th St. and Campbell.  This entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza!  They did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in Architects Digest some 8 years ago (or more) when they opened.  It's become something of a low key meeting hub with ""great date"" written all over the place.  Any given night of the week you will find this place a' buzz!  So plan on a wait, unless it's early in the evening or very early in the week - like Monday.  Open for lunch and open late; again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry.  Look cute, because this is where the beautiful people hang out in Phoenix, sans attitude.  Moderately priced.

1895,"I love this place!  I just recently moved to San Francisco from Arizona, but I already made sure to visit it on my first trip back.  I have never brought someone there and had them not like it. The atmosphere is great - small and cozy, and very warmly decorated for a former post office.  The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts, and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar.   Service is typically good unless they are super busy (Friday and Saturday).In addition to the wine choices, the bruschetta is awesome!  My favorite is the red pepper goat cheese, but I've also heard very good things about the proscuittomascarponefig one.  You order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options.The only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the SE Valley - it is a far drive from Chandler or Gilbert to the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix.  Here's a tip though: when you get there, don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot, there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby.

1898,"Also on my sweltering trip to Phoenix I visited this place.  My good friend's brother is one of the bartenders (Sam) so we had to check it out. Sat at the bar for a late afternoon lunch.  Started off with a glass of champagne just because I was on vacation and I could :)   We also had some champagne mixers they were making specially that day that were really nice.I had some trouble deciding what to eat since the menu all looks so tasty but i went with the bruchetta.  I mean, come on, you get to choose 4 toppings, how could I not!  I even had a hard time choosing only 4!  I had the apple with brie and fig spread (my favorite), roasted red pepper with goat cheese (very good), prosciutto with figs and marscapone (wow) and salami with pesto (great).  All of this for $12 and HUGE!  Four heaping pieces of bread cut into four pieces each.  My friend also got the roasted artichoke one which was just as delicious.  Three glasses of champagne and more bruschetta than I could possibly eat I was extremely satisfied.  I've been actually thinking lately...where can I get this delicious food in LA

The retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent, the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites.  If you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino, the restaurant offers ""wine education"" courses.  My fiance and I attended a weekly ""Wine 101"" course a couple of years back.  Each week, we sampled a different genre of wine including reds, whites, dessert wines, and champagnes.  Also, each week included a guest speaker, usually a sales rep for a wine maker.

My husband rolls his eyes when I suggest Lucy's cause I am not a cheap date there, but he likes it too. He even threw a surprise bday party for me there, recently - and it was all perfect.

The owners are great. I think every time I have been there(a lot) one of them has stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was great. I know this place has just transferred ownership, and MAN they are doing everything right. It was good when I first started going, and now it is GREAT!

This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head!They just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!)To top it off, this place even offers wine 101 classes, grape varietal classes, and even a book club!

I also tried the antipasto plate and was happy to see it came with a little salad that helped to balance out the saltiness of the meats. The cheese and olives that it came with were a great accompaniment to the wine we were drinking that night. This place is awesome because their bottle prices are extremely reasonable in price and they have some diverse options. The comfy couches and relaxed atmosphere make it a great place to just hang out with friends for hours.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and they are great at recommending new wines.

They have lights strung across the patio and it gives a great ambiance in the evening.

It wasn't too cheesy and the sauce on top was perfect.  We also loved Pesto's take on the caprese, with greens added.  There were lots of options for wine too.    The hubby tried the pepperoni pizza and said it was ""okay"", but he's picky when it comes to pizza.Granted, we did go early but there were too many kids for my liking.  If you're looking for a more ""adult"" environment, I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  As we were leaving, they were setting up some live music.  We'll definitely be back!!

1915,"After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)

1916,"I don't get out to Chandler much. But a friend's bridal shower ended up being held here. From the food to the service, everything could not have gone smoother. I heard they had recently remodeled the place. Well...bravo! Everything is tastefully decorated. Looks like a great place to get your happy hour on. There was a beaded curtain that sort of separates the bar area from the dining area. But it's a metallic bead curtain so not at all hippie-like. I can't believe a place like this is inside a strip mall with a Safeway.The theme of the shower was wine and cocktails. The bartender--the owner's daughter--was super hospitable and personable. For our party, she demonstrated how to make four different cocktails. And the owner even went to the trouble of printing out the cocktail recipes on specially decorated paper. The owner is a lovely woman with a lovely personality. The owner is actually good friend's with the bride's mom. So, I don't know if the restaurant would do that for any party. But judging by how nice she was, I'm sure they would do something if asked and offered reasonable payment. And everyone was raving about the cocktails which were truly very good. My favorite was a chocolate martini. The bartender was skilled at taste as well as presentation. For the food, we had a yummy cheese plate which included a parmesan cheese with honey for dipping, a truffle flavored cheese and another cheese that came with a pesto dip. We also had some scrumptious stuffed mushrooms. And for pizza, we went with the pesto and Mediterranean (sun dried tomatoes, chicken and feta cheese). The pizzas were thin crust and piping hot. And the cheese in my opinion was melted to the right consistency. It took all my power not to shove down more pieces when not everybody had gotten some yet. I was happy with the food and level of service. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I only wished I lived closer so I could visit Pesto's on a week day.

My husband and I are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered. I especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub I had, it was one of the best I've ever had. The wine flights are really great, you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes. The pours are generous, you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight. We will definitely be going back!

1919,"I was in town for a quick trip and needed a place to grab a late dinner.  From the Yelp description I only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews - I didn't realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern.  Pesto's is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards.  Instead, it's a very nice spot to take a date, or to just belly up to the bar solo (as I did).Service was friendly and fast, and a good selection of alcohol (especially liquor) is on hand.Great atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious calzone. Drenched in sauce and absolutely delicious.

1924,"My mother is a member here and she wanted to come for a family dinner over the holidays.  They have completely remodeled this country club which was long overdue and it is so gorgeous now.   It is hard to put into words the transformation this place has undergone.  It does not look anything like it used to except for maybe the golf course and the parking lot.  Our server was young and was probably used to going through the motions of serving tables, but we were there to enjoy ourselves and have drinks and conversation... when we clued him into our intentions he was fine with that and very accommodating.  There was one minor incident where he spilled my cosmopolitan on my sisters fiance, but he handled it like a champ:).  We actually felt really bad for him because we know that is a servers worst nightmare... he was lucky that he did that to our table and not another club member... somehow i don't think they would have been as nice as we were.  Our food was very good and our server was a great guy too!  We had a great time at the Arizona Country Club.

The club is private, but you are allowed a limited number of visits without joining.  There is usually a dinner on Saturday nights (check the website for details).  The quality of the meals prepared by the members is good, and again the pricing is reasonable.  Non-members can enjoy a meal also.  Just call the club by Thursday to make a reservation.  Absolutely one of my favorite places to have a beer in Las Vegas.  Surreal atmosphere, warm and friendly people (almost none of them are German ;))) and delicious German beer on tap!The Club itself (known as the GASCON)  is pretty neat too.  They have a couple boozy golf tournaments a year, which are a lot of fun, and also do a fantastic job hosting the Oktoberfest in DT Las Vegas.  Annual membership is like $35.  I carry my card in my wallet.  The GASCON is making a push to increase the headcount of its younger members (hold your national socialist youth movement jokes please ;))).  There's talk of using the space on the off nights as a music venue and also of hosting viewing parties for both the US and Germany games at the 2014 World Cup.  I'll be there...

I know a German Restaurant in town that could use the charm of this place!!!!It has a full bar (with German beer -of course!) and kitchen (kitchen is usually only used for their Tuesday Night Vintage Vegas Jazz evenings, Saturday Dinners and the once a month Sunday brunch.  They said the Club is also available for Special Event rentals. Most of the members are above the age of 50 (but I was told they have been getting a small influx of younger members recently).  Best to check their website for hours of operation, But they are open Tuesday evenings for Jazz,  (sometimes) on Thursday evenings, Friday and Saturday afternoon and evenings and the once a month Sunday brunch.  The bar prices are cheap! It is an all ages club, so you can bring your children there (just not in the bar section).  This is a ""Private Club"", but they said guests can come Three times to experience it before signing up. Oh the dues... if you do want to join, it costs $3 a month !!! ($35 the first year), and $2 a month for following years ($25 for renewal years). What a bargain!  Yes, I ended signing my wife and I up we love it so much!

1932,"The Leatherneck Club is totally cool. My boy Mo turned me on to this place, as he and his Vet buddies from Operation Desert Storm used to go there and swap tales with the oldtimers. It is practically a museum to the USMC, with all sorts of insignia, signage, pictures and even war souvenirs like captured kalishnikov rifles, grenades, and flags from WWII and Vietnam. Plus, after drinking there and staggering out into the night, you feel like you are in Singapore or Hanoi, what with the neon lights, asian signage and massage parlors everywhere. If you are a marine, you are to REPORT THERE IMMEDIATELY OR DROP AND GIVE ME TWENTY. Hoo -Ra!

1936,"I belong to a Marine Corps League detachment and one of the old timers told me about this joint. What better place to put a Marine bar than smack dab in the middle of Chinatown and right next to an Asian massage parlor no less I can neither confirm nor deny that the massages at the aforementioned establishment have a happy ending, but I can tell you that if you are a Marine or a devil doc, checking out this place IS A MUST! If you are the child or grandchild of a Marine or devil doc, or even a new girlfriend of one, bringing your vet here during your next Vegas trip IS A MUST.They didn't lie when they said they have some of the coldest beer in town. They carry both import and domestic, but sadly no Dos XX's. No drink is over $5 and they pour pretty strong. They also have a few beers on tap to include a hefenweizen. Deb was our bartender and her husband Spider cooks in the galley, and they have lunch specials and Friday night dinners too. From what I hear, Spider cooks a mean meal and even does catering for the events that go on at their hall, which is available to rent for special events.They are home to the Marine Corps Riders motorcycle club as well. inside their hall, they have memorabilia from WWI all the way up to OIFOEF ranging from uniforms to campaign commemorative K-bars and even enemy articles as well. I am sure they'd take any kind of donations if you have them to add to their museum. I noticed they didn't have much air wing stuff so I donated my squadron patch (HMH-465) to them. If you want gear to take home, they have a small PX and sell challenge coins and T-shirts from their MCL detachment and a few basic USMC veterans covers too.The last bit of info I can pass on is that its a little hard to find cause its in the middle of the Arville Shoppingtown Square ant can't easily be seen from the street. Just look for the big yellow MASSAGE sign with red lettering on the right hand side. You can't miss it!  And you won't want to either! Its just like being in an E-club on base and I'd imagine just like the SNCO or O clubs too. They have a few regulars there and a retired colonel whose a member there made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in the doo and even bought me and my compadre, also a Marine a couple of shots.

Thank goodness for the Neighborhood Theater, then, not only for being a great venue for a fan, but for being the type of venue that I think a lot of bands would really enjoy playing.The main performance space is airy and well ventilated, especially when they've got that monster ceiling fan running.  Where did they find that thing  On the Death StarI also like that they've got seating in addition to the standing-only floor space.  I sat through three bands in a row a few weeks ago, comfy as I could be in my padded seat.  Might make me sound geriatric, but I appreciated taking a load off.I was all the more comfortable as a result of the excellent beer selection at the concession.  They've got a top notch bunch of brews, including Sierra Nevada, Bell's, and Sweetwater.  Nice job on that.To top it all, the acoustics are great, and it's pretty conveniently located.Neighborhood theater is the type of place Charlotte cannot afford to be without, and I'm looking forward to many more shows there.

Go when the doors open to reserve a seat, then go grab a cocktail and explore NoDa (The Dog Bar and Cabo Fish Taco are two other favorites in the area)!  Prefer to stand!

1950,"I must reiterate what an amazing place this is and how it is absolutely a staple not only to the NoDa area, but the entire live music seen in Charlotte.  I apologize for my quick review before but most of my write ups are about food, so I was just straight to the point.Sooooo, much history here, and more to be made.  Many bluegrass legends such as Doc Waston, Del McCourey, and Acoustic Syndicate.  Other genre's such as Little Feet, Rusted Root, and even members of Crosby, Sills, and Nash have graced these doors.  Too many too mention.   There are many free shows quite often and its one of the biggest venues where you can still feel that intimate vibe from your favorite artists, IMO.  1000ish capacity I'd say.FIRST OF ALL:Don't park in their parking lot unless your in a hurry, there are plenty of free spots up and down the sidestreets of the area.As soon as you walk up and see the marque, you know the place is legit.  Once you walk in the can see the side stage if open and a bar to your left, always filled with friendly faces.  There are plenty of good beers on tap($4 for a stone IPA being my favorite) at this cash only bar.For most larger shows, this side stage I speak of, is rarely noticed and the dance floor for it is open for you to watch the main stage in the next room over.  That is where the fun is.  There is normally a dance floor open up front with seating behind it, but when ""softer"", more singer songwriter type shows happen they pull out the seats for all.  Another option is the balcony upstairs(which is full of seats), is normally a great place to be, because many that don't know the theater well don't know about it, although it can get a little hot up there.  The VIP section may be worth it to you as having a waitress is nice, but you'll pay a little more for the ticket.The place is nice, but the talent they pull is amazing, rarely if ever have I heard anything not at least listenable, and except for a couple free acts everything I've seen there has sounded great.  This place normally has something going on all the time, and coincides with the gallery crawls too.  This is a piece of Charlotte that has to be witnessed, read the calendar, if you don't see anything you recognize, read some reviews of the bands, I have a feeling there is something there for almost everybody.  At least go buy and check out the free arts market when it happens.Hope to see ya there, I'll probably be the guy with a beer in his hand standing front row.
",others
1951,"Great place to see any show!  Large venue, they use curtains to section it off for smaller shows but the place is huge.  In the main stage area there is the biggest fan I've ever seen, possibly bigger than most helicopter blades, and it churns out hurricane like wind that will literally blow you off your feet.  There is a huge mushroom statue right inside the entrance that appropriately makes you feel like you are falling down the rabbit hole.... which side of the mushroom did you eat They have $3 PBRs on draft which is a nice deal.  The bathrooms are by no means high-class but they do have awesome, high-tech, eco-friendly hand dryers that remind me the old school operation game, don't hit the side or you lose.  Ps- they sell earplugs here if you forget to bring your own!  but if you value your hearing I would recommend having a pair stashed in your back pocket.

1952,"This place is dramatically better inside since they fixed it up. The once dinky bar counter is now a full on bar with plenty of seating and selection. Various types or art adorns the wall, though it's a little dark to fully appreciate some of it. The lighting is appropriate for everything else though.They didn't really change the stage area. There is still a giant stage with tons of space in front of it and plenty of dancing and sitting room. There is one new thing in the stage room. You can access a section of the bar now, which is awesome.The is one let down. I'm not sure if they are fixing it up or it's just been closed but you can no longer get up on the balcony, which used to be one of my favorite places to relax. Hopefully they have it open again. But all and all, I love what they did with the place.

1960,"I have been a student of the True Buddha School most of my life. The School is global, with the main headquarters in Redmond, Washington. I recently moved to Charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here. The people here are some of the nicest I've met! The services are all mostly conducted in Chinese and the attendees are also mostly Chinese, so it can be very disconcerting for non-Chinese speakers. Don't be intimidated! Culturally, there are differences, but everyone is good people! :) On a day-to-day basis, the English is limited, but we definitely have quite a few English speakers dotted within. If you have questions or want to learn more, please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an English speaker. We are usually there on Sundays. Regular weekly service (usually group cultivation + meditation) is from 11-1. You can feel free to come by and observe, and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards. And you would be more than welcome to stay for lunch.There are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to English. Printed words only get you so far. The best thing to do is to track down an English-speaker and ask everything you've ever wanted to ask. There are no stupid questions, only ""teachers"" who may not know the best answer. :)Currently and at least through the end of the year (2014), we have a dharma class being taught in English from 1:30 to 3. It gets into some of the nitty gritty of Buddhism, so if you are a beginner, I'd recommend talking to someone before jumping into class. Either way, anyone and everyone is welcome.TBS is open to everyone, Chinese or not, and of any religious background!Our spiritual leader is Living Buddha Lian Sheng. Our dharma and our practice encompasses all Buddhist schools of Mahayana, Hinayana, and mostly Vajrayana. While other temples and societies may practice differently, we all believe in the same basic precepts of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

1961,"If you have a interest in Buddhism and don't know anyone who is Buddhist or just want to experience this first hand. This is the most welcoming group of people you will ever meet. They are willing to explain the Buddhist practice to you one on one or within a group. There are meetings that take place throughout the valley so if this is to far to go to call them they will help you get teamed up with someone in your neighborhood which is nice. They also have a website that explains the practice as well but I must say you have to experience this first hand. Hearing the discussion and interacting with someone first hand is the best way to truly understand this practice.
",others
1962,"This is the most welcoming and diverse religious group I've found in Las Vegas.  I use the term ""religious"" loosely because many, including myself would argue that Buddhism is more of a philosophy for life and well being.  Much of Buddhism does not fall under the general ""religion"" rules.  No prosthelytizing, no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a ""heaven and hell"" or all-knowing higher power.The SGI-USA Buddhist Center focuses on a particular brand of Buddhism known as Soka-Gakkai, which is the most established and followed form of Buddhism in the United States.  I was told that the President of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the Las Vegas area was a crucial place to have a presence.I went to the community center a few months back to check it all out.  Luckily I got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends.  You're likely to hear a lot of chanting, perhaps a video from an SGI presidential address in Japan, and lots of people talking about how Buddhism has improved their lives.  What struck me most is the diversity.  You'll find people from all ages, races, and walks of life.  No formal dress code.  Just come as you are.There are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain SGI Buddhism  to newcomers.  Much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood, often hosted at a member's home.  I haven't been back much since I'm still exploring other forms of Buddhism.  But those who are interested will find this as an excellent starting point.

Its been open about a Year and a half. It was built with the environment in mind and is very green. The Bookstore was closed but i peered in and although this one is smaller it still has a lot of space. They used it well. They have a office for your use, and a Main Room to chant, and a over flow room. Then 2 other rooms that double as conference rooms and have smaller gohonzon's in them as well. We talked for a while and gave me some names of the people whos district ill be in. And he wondered back outside to finish landscaping while i chanted for a bit.

1970,"This is actually for the Thai street food thing that they have every month. All the food was amazing, and for the price it was well worth it.Pad Thai - for 5 dollars you can have possibly some of the best pad thai in Vegas.Fish Ball and Beef noodle soup - same price, 5 bucks, amazing soup.

1971,"I've been meaning to try their monthly fundraiser for a while, so glad I finally did. Super cheap and delish food prepared mostly to order by cute little Thai grandmas. Huge portion of mango sticky rice for $6 - everything else maxed out at $5. We tried chicken pad thai, pork and chicken satay for $1skewer, and papaya salad which my friend says was the best he's ever had. We got a bunch of asstd snacks, mostly coconutty things for $1-$2. They had flower like things just like Hawaii style Chinese pretzels, and steamed cakes like Filipino poto. Can't wait to go back next month 519! Btw cash only of course.

1972,"I was amazingly surprised to see my childhood monk's monastery on yelp.I grew up being raised Buddhist, so I went to numerous monasteries in the Las Vegas area. This is by far the best Buddhist temple in Las Vegas. The decor is beautiful inside and it is very spacious so you aren't crammed next to each other when you meditate. Arjahn Chaiya, the lead monk is extremely helpful when you want to learn about the Buddhist religion; he does not come off strong like most religious practitioners, which is a big plus. He is very respectful of other religions and beliefs.Although I do not practice Buddhism any more, I still come to pay my respects to Arjahn Chaiya, but I also come for the monthly food fair that is popularly reviewed on yelp. Some of the food is good, but not spectacular; however, the items that are there every month that are AMAZING are the Moo Yahng (Pork Skewers) and Guay Tiew Nam (Rice Noodle Soup). All in all, its a nice, spacious, and beautiful monastery to practice Buddhism and it is a delicious cultural find!

1974,"""Do good and be good; not to do any evil, to cultivate good, to purify one's mind- this is the teaching of the Buddhas."" -CMM websiteChaiya Meditation Monastery hosts a monthly food fair that many attend for the inexpensive, tasty Thai food, with proceeds going towards paying the monastery's mortgage.  I've been to the food fair several times, but never really looked around the monastery grounds until this month.  Visitors are welcome to cross the colorful bridge and explore the outdoor meditation area that is obviously well-tended to by the monks and nuns who reside at the monastery.  At the time I walked through, it was only myself and one of the monks was there, doing a little gardening.  It's not a very large area, but it does have several beautiful Buddhist statues, a pavilion, a golden tower, and sidewalks that visitors can walk along to see this intimate place of worship.  According to the website, the monastery offers daily meditation classes that are open to the public, one from 9:00am-10:00am and another from 5:00-6:00pm.  For more info, go to www.chaiyacmm.org.I'm definitely not an expert on Buddhism, but from what I've seen of the monastery, it's obvious that the goal of providing a tranquil space for meditation and some peace for those of any religion (or no religion at all) has been met by Chaiya.

1976,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Kinesphere, and owner Dominika. She recently lead a private class for my monthly women's group, kindly opening the studio late to us and allowing our group to bring in refreshments.Upon walking in the door to see a welcome note to my group on their lobby chalkboard, we immediately left the outside world behind us. The studio is gorgeous, clean, comfortable and peaceful. Dominika instructed us on ""relax and release"" techniques, expertly demonstrating the use of foam rollers and other equipment for stress relieving stretches.Dominika welcomed our questions during the demonstration and easily managed to correct and assist the entire group that evening so that we each had a great (and valuable) experience. I have gotten great feedback from all of our attendees on our visit. The staff at Kinesphere have their priorities straight, they made each of us (with varying degrees of experience and different fitness levels) comfortable. I will definitely be returning to Kinesphere and highly recommend it.

1981,"So much fun here!  We are learning excellent skills, but we are always having a good laugh and enjoying the time.  I spend all day working in front of a computer, so my body gets very stiff.  I leave the dojo feeling completely stretched out and my body feels better all week.  I'm so glad I found this place and I recommend it to anyone who has any interest in Aikido, Tai Chi, or simply needs a new fun way to get out of a seated position!

Besides techniques, he also has a vast store of knowledge based on experience that makes his classes truly comprehensive and applicable to the real world.  And on top of all that, he's a great guy who makes training fun.

1983,"The new dojo is great. They thought a lot about the mat and it feels good on the feet and it's almost enjoyable to fall. Definitely one of the best in town, if not the best.Angus teaches non-traditional aikido and tai chi, and his style of teaching is very flexible and fun. It's a good way to de-stress after work and we're definitely learning valuable martial arts. Everyone who goes to class are also very nice people.

1984,"This place is like a little Italian grocery and a prepared foods shop.  They have the best fresh pasta (I love how it takes like 2 minutes to cook)- they have a bunch of different kinds of ravioli, spaghetti, and other classic Italian dishes.  If you want to try something a little different the sweet potato ravioli is awesome!  I also highly reccomend their sauces and breads.  This place also has a pretty decent wine selction.  This is the perfect to stop and pick-up something that you can prepare at home in minutes.
",others
1985,"Taste the difference with the fresh pasta from this place!Yes,. you can buy ""fresh"" pasta in the grocery store, but don't. IT ain't so fresh.The lobster and crab ravioli was outstanding when combined with my own recipe for vodka sauce, i added shrimp and viola my guests were impressed. I love it because although I enjoy cooking,ravioli is last on my list to whip up in the kitchen.I've also purchased the cavatelli in the past and was fantastic along with my simple broccoli and garlic sauce.based on the taste and freshness of the  Pasta I give five stars , skip the chicken dishes in IMO.Also love the wine selection.Oh and they have Cannolis!
",others
1986,"This place is amazing. I lived in Rome Italy for 6 months and this is as close as it comes in Charlotte. They have make to order fresh pasta that is fabulous. Great rosemary focaccia, over 15 different types of ravioli, lots of Italian wine and groceries as well. Yum!
",others
1987,"Is the amazing array of Italian imported oils, pastas, cheeses, wines, canned and jarred veggies and such more expensive than your average high-end grocery store Yeah.Does it cost more to buy their made-in-house spaghettini or ravioli than HT's failed attempts Of course.But who cares. Everyone that works here is awesome, you can taste almost anything in the cold case before purchasing, open kitchen in the back so you can watch, if you tire of shopping...it's an impressive little store that deserves the extra buck or two. Or three. Hell, maybe even four.Lately (for you meaters) they've branched out and have started stocking Grateful Grower's sausage and some other hard-to-find NC fine meats, as well as their standard Italian selection.There's also a fridge with sauces, pastas, etc in the PM Common Market, if you don't feel like making the drive down Providence, and the parking kinda sucks... but go at least once. Rad little store.
",others
1988,"Pasta & Provisions is amazing!  You really should go there, now.  Right now.  Everything from the homemade pasta, ready to eat salads and grilled veggies, the sauces, the meatballs, the wine selection and the focaccia.  It's pretty hard not to get wrapped up into buying every item they sell.  It's all so fresh and local, it's like a dream!  And let me tell you a little something about the focaccia.  On a recent trip to Asheville my uncle asked if I could pick him up two rounds of focaccia.  He said, ""they just don't make focaccia like that up here.""  You know it's good when you're taking out of town requests.  The entire entity is where it's at!  Owner, Tommy George has really created a family atmosphere in this authentic shop.  I always walk away, with a pep in my step, feeling great about supporting this local business and of course, hungry.  The pasta literally melts in your mouth and the meatballs are the best I've ever had.  This food is perfect for dinner parties, big family meals andor a quiet date night at home.  And, of course it's good for you!  Eat Pasta Run Fasta!

1989,"*Advanced apologies for this being so long! :)""Sono nell'amore"" - I'm in love!  I wanted to burst into a child-like conniption right on the floor because I couldn't buy one (or more) of everything...someone hold me.  But I digress!  This is a FANTASTIC little shop - a lotta stuff packed in a small space & it seems to be quite popular.  Parking was a smidge daunting, but there is more in the back...but be careful since the tiny ally only allows for one car & you might get in the ""I'm trying to leave but no I'M trying to come in"" face-off!  The rear lot is shared with Providence Sundries & was pretty full when I was there around 12:30ish on a Thursday.Found the staff to be SUPER helpful, friendly & knowledgeable, especially as to which sauce would pair well with what pasta (all homemade in house btw)- one girl (didn't catch her name) offered to show me around the store & explain things when she learned it was my first time in, which was a huge help (although the shop is relatively small it's still kind of overwhelming at first).  Once the tour was over I wandered about on my own to soak it all in.  The atmosphere is easy with music playing in the background at juuust the right volume and a view to the kitchen in the back.  One cool thing they do is whenever someone orders any of their fresh pasta, they send it sailing from the kitchen to the register up front down a long wire attached to a clip (watch your head!) - FUN!   PS - you choose how you want your pasta cut: Angel Hair, Spaghetti, Linguine or Fettuccine.They have a huge menu board up front that spells out exactly what's in each pasta, ravioli and sauce, so you know just what you're getting.  Plus you see how NATURAL everything is.I walked away with THE most delicious Greek White Bean Spread & loaf of Rosemary Focaccia bread (which I am munching on as we speak)...just marvelous.  Also picked up a pound of fresh garlicrosemary pasta cut fettuccini style (only 2 mins to cook!), house-made alfredo and pomodoro sauces, and a pound of shrimp ravioli (prebagged).  They even gave me a treat just bc it was my first time there - how awesome is THAT!   They're my new bestest friends :)For those SIX, local, house-made items, my total came to $30 and change.   Taking into account I was supporting a local business and getting true FRESH items, made BY those locals, I don't think that was half bad.  One other thing I like about P&P is that their prices are fixed & do not fluctuate as they see fit any given day like many other places of this type, and from what I could gather (didn't ask, so..) everything is always available - they even give you a ""menu"" when you check out.  This is especially handy if you're trying to plan for a special dinner or get-together.  True, you are gonna pay more than you would at the grocery store, and at times quite a bit more, but it really IS worth it (especially for many of the ""provisions"").  Once we've munched on the pastas & sauces I'll update this.  But as of this moment in time I'm drooling over my newfound love.  Everyone should visit P&P at least once, especially if you love to cook, play in the kitchen, or even just browse & get ideas for a simple meal for two since they're more they happy to help.  OH...and they have very reasonable hours, including Saturday AND Sunday!!!  See you there :)

1990,"Yup, I am in love with Pasta & Provisions. Not just because they have freshly piped cannolis, but also because they have such a great selection of fresh Italian fare and ingredients. Plus, the employees are ridiculously nice and helpful.Their fridge selection has all sorts of delicious traditional, home-made Italian goodies: meatballs & marinara, stuffed jumbo shells, lasagna, tiramisu, fresh pasta, etc. If your seeking specialty Italian items - this is the place to go. They have special canned tomatoes, imported pastas, wines, cheeses, etc. that will elevate your dish to the next level. They also offer large scale meals and catering for the ""I'm pretending I can cook Italian"" dinner parties. :)And back the cannolis...holy yum, this is the first place in Charlotte where I've found fresh cannolis...if only I could convince them to make them with pistachios! Mmmm thanks, Pasta & Provisions! I'll be back soon!

1992,"I came here on a trip with a few other girls. We had all never been there before and seeked pasta and sauce for a pasta dinner. The staff was incredibly helpful and told us exactly how much pasta and sauce we needed. We had the garlic and rosemary linguini with their homemade pomodoro and marinara sauce (mix 1 part pomodoro, 2 parts marinara). It was incredible! We also had meatballs which I highly recommend. For $20, we fed 5 hungry runners! You only have to boil the fresh pasta for 60-90 seconds so it was really fast too.They have these little chocolates on a shelf called ""liquid coffee"" for $.75 that I got on a whim-SO amazing and now I have to find out where else I could find them!

1996,"I am on run of local reviews here and I want to end it on my all time favorite food: pasta.  I discovered this local gem at the Phoenix Farmer's Market about a month ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  I love to cook pasta dishes and have been known to try my hand at making pasta with varying degrees of success.  Well, these guys make me look pathetic.  Their pasta is dried and cooks up in a scant 2-4 minutes.  The variety of flavors is outrageous: spinach, mushroom, garlic, roasted tomato, and so on.  These pastas are what I would call stand-alones.  You literally need to add nothing to eat for consumption.  Maybe some nice local olive oil ( mad props to Queen Creek Olive Mill! ) and some shavings of parm and you are golden...I would almost chug the remaining pasta water if it wasn't so damn hot!  Love the pasta  and love the fact that it's local people!  Go local!!!!

1997,"I bought some of their pasta last weekend and am in love! I am hooked on the basil spinach, just a little salt and pepper and good olive oil. So good! I highly recommend them.

1998,"So much for my commitment to consume fewer carbs.  I think this pasta could single-handedly kill the already dying Atkins industry.  I first tried Decio pasta at an event at the Botanical Gardens, and was happy to find them again at Old Town Farmers Market.  This pasta is air-dried and cooks in half the time of ordinary dried pasta, and it's unbelievably flavorful.  With varieties from Artichoke hearts to Wild Mushroom, you can get your veggies out of the way.  Well, not really, but it's as close as I get most days.  The first time I tried a sample, I asked what was in it and couldn't believe it was only a little of the cooking water and a tablespoon or two of butter.  While the directions (which I never bothered to read) do recommend you rinse this pasta, I never did and never needed to.  But I did find I should have done so with the lemon pepper.  I'm not sure why this was so much starchier than my favored spinach, basil, and garlic, but it was definitely too sticky.At  $6 a package (4 for $20 at the markets), this is one of the best inexpensive meals you can find that doesn't end in ""berto.""  And who can't boil water
