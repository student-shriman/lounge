0,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.,food
1,"Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as ""Jumbo"".",food
2,"This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.",food
3,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.,food

5,"I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",food
6,"This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!",food
7,This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!,food

When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.

30,"I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up).

32,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.",food
33,"This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.",food
34,"Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning.

41,"McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.",food

47,"The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.",food
48,"I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.",food

They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms.

I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.

Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a ""salty"" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.",food

There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price.

73,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",food

77,These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer.

82,"I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",food

As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.",food
85,"We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.",food
86,"My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.",food
87,My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!,food
88,Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.,food
89,"Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!",food
90,I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.,food

93,"My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.",food
94,This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.,food
95,I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.,food
96,"My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more ""bang for your buck"" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!",food
97,Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.,food
98,"My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.

It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).",food

I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says ""only 60 calories per jar!"" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",food

111,I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.,food
112,"I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.",food

118,"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.",food

I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!",food
120,"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.",food
121,This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.,food
122,"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.",food
123,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",food
124,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",food

Great item, great price too, highly recommend!",food
144,"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.

I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!",food
174,I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.,food

After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.",food
183,"We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.",food

186,"This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",food

Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with).",food

The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.",food
209,"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.",food
210,"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.",food
211,"We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really ""feeling better"" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.",food
212,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on.",food
213,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!",food

217,"My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.",food

At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest.

So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg.",food
220,"I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label ""Imperial Blend"" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea.",food

It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.",food

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.",food

242,"Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)",food
243,I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.,food
244,Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.,food
245,"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.",food
246,"I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range.

If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares?",food
247,"Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.

I've just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great!, but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next. This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well.  I'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way. I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon.",food

253,I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free. I have been using this product for over a year. I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.,food
254,"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money.",food
255,"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!",food

This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership.",food

The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A""). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.",food

I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!!

It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.

It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.",food

It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me.

Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.<br /><br />She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level.

The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price.

I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales.",food

I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!",food

I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.",food

I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.",food

He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.

The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!",food

383,"I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again.

The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them.

There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used.",food

Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two.

It's very much ""an English thing"" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in ""Victoria Beckham is Marmite"" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).

I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients.

424,"After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.",food

430,"I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC"">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.",food

I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.",food
435,"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.",food

I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).",food

The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."" I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions ""tear here."" So easy. Why didn't I think of that.",food
440,"Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars.

I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.",food
442,Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.,food

Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.",food

These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!",food

450,"I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!",food

No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)",food

I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?

If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.",food

I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.

I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.",food

How can you go wrong?<br /><br />Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food.",food
497,"Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.",food

These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.

508,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.",food

It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.

OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.",food

Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned.

I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.<br /><br />Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.<br /><br />Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream, some products are worth the money.

Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!",food
528,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",food

This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon.",food

Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way.

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.

560,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.",food

Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.

They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!

Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat.

I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.

They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

620,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.

You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.

At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.

Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch.",food

I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!",food
652,"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.",food
653,"If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).",food

But actually, that may just be my own over-caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance.<br /><br />Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt, using it in the little baking I do, and use in salad dressings, fruit desserts, etc. Because we are limiting our sweets consumption,we don't use a lot of this, but it's nice to have when we need it.

I've tried supermarkets, health food stores and wholesale clubs. The prices are usually around $13 for a 32oz bottle and this is $19ish for 2x46oz.

Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.",food

712,"My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.

716,"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate.

Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.",food

The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.

We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.",food

The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time.",food

I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!",food
738,"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this.",food

740,"I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!<br /><br />This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting you'd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency...",food

And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried.",food

744,"This is pretty good canned meat. The sausage I used in dirty rice, the hamburger I used for taco salad, the chicken with wild rice, and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I don't eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild ""spam""-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why!

The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.

However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.",food
766,"This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.",food

Nothing wrong with Whitman's, but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nice.<br /><br />As a sampler, it provides only a few of the Milka options. Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I don't like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.<br /><br />Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle.

I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box.

851,"The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}.

852,"I'm happy with the quality of the product and the price. Like the other reviewer, I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness.

856,"I looooove pocky, got once at lucky's and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.<br /><br />Great product, and great price from this merchant!",food
857,"Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated.",food
858,"Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.  As far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  Definitely a good buy.",food
859,"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)",food
860,The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan.,food
861,"First of all, I love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldn't have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi goreng...it was delicious!!! I now love mi goreng.",food
862,"I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't ""terrible"" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.",food
863,Bought these for my daughter's Grad party as well as the Strawberry. She loves these things. They're a great product.,food
864,Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this.  It is addicting.  That includes our 3 year old.,food
865,"Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).",food
866,"Pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, I was impressed with Very Asia's packaging. I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer. On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo. T_T So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away, but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading ""PROTECT FROM HEAT"" and my pocky arriving in perfect condition! (Well, they did stick together just a bit). I love Very Asia more than anything now.",food
867,"I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly. The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and doesn't taste as it should. Many of them stick together, and whenever I want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it.",food
868,Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they don't they are lying lol. The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces.,food
869,"These where great couldnt stop eating them.<br />Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time.<br />Cant say enough about these, they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped also.<br />Thank you so much.",food
870,"I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity, search for Pocky commercials on youtube!",food
871,The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.,food
872,"This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The ""clusters"" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods.",food
873,This was the first peanut free product I bought for my son.  I thought they were tasty.  The kids liked them too.  For some reason they think they are strawberry bars.  I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state.  It makes for clean car rides.  Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best.  Berry is always left for last.  Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item.,food
874,"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free.",food
875,"My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!",food

877,i love them. not too sweet but just right. any allergy free food is great in my book. hope non of these ingredients contains Corn...thats a no no for me too. HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 1/4 OF IT OFF. IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE. THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN. I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE,food
878,"I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients.",food
879,Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.,food
880,"With all the allergies in our family, these ended up working out great.  We don't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we don't buy many pre packaged foods, these work for 'on-the-go'. Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars; they're almost like a Tootsie Roll to me-though I can't eat Tootsie Rolls, so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving.  My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast, need a healthy snack, or my son will take them on his cross country running meets.  They are very dense and filling-not a 'soft bar' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time.",food

My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.<br /><br />Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded.",food

895,"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.",food

I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein.",food
908,"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far.",food
909,"I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all.",food
910,Would be a quality product if it weren't so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be.,food
911,"I would love to say that I have the time to make my son's food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.",food
912,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family.",food
913,Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found!,food
914,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon.",food
915,"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick.",food
916,"My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.",food
917,This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times).,food
918,My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.,food
919,"I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price.",food
920,"I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing.",food
921,My son really enjoys Earth's Best lentil!  He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more.  The product shipped very quickly.,food
922,"I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite.",food
923,"We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein.",food
924,I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.,food
925,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.,food
926,"This is one of my son's favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  It's more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up.",food
927,"For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. I'm not a fan myself, but I'm not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, I'm a happy mom.",food
928,The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.,food
929,"My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!",food
930,I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her,food
931,"From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.",food
932,"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help.",food
933,"This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time.",food
934,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack.",food
935,"My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.<br /><br />We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors.",food
936,My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat.  If we are going somewhere I won't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.,food
937,My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.,food
938,"My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn't like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it.",food
939,My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.,food
940,To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.,food
941,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!",food
942,"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin.",food
943,"This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.",food
944,"The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny.",food
945,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.,food
946,I didn't eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.,food
947,I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.,food
948,Pretty good product.  The taste isn't the best but it's definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.,food

953,As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.,food
954,"I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or ""bark"" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.",food
955,I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.,food

957,I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!,food
958,"bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn't had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he'd shut up.",food
959,"I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again.",food
960,Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .<br />Thanks Kim:D,food
961,"I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree.",food
962,"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.",food
963,"These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or ""best by"" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June ""use by"" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to specify ""use by"" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.  I'm assuming that Amazon won't ship stuff that has ""expired"", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the ""use by"" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice.",food

965,"I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be. $13.95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around $1.09. Now as far as the item itself, this brand of Panang Paste is excellent. The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant. I would recommend the paste but not the price.",food
966,"Best paste I have tried! So easy to use. Just saute you meat, add veggies, paste, and a tin of coconut milk. Quick and tasty! I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat. It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter.. but the yellow, green, and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out.",food
967,"OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star.",food

973,"I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.",food

This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don't have access to a coffee maker.

I was delighted to find these Folger's bags.<br /><br />  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I'm not any kind of coffee expert, so I don't know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.<br /><br />  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty.

I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.

1016,"On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.",food

Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything.

1052,"They claim this product is ""unadulterated"", which would make you think ""oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's ""unadulterated"".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier.

I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.

ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.""

AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!",food

1076,"Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.",food

Each bag also has a little story, courtesy of Uncle Ray, that usually has some moral message or anecdote. They are pretty funny, but not intentionally.

I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised with these chips.  Somehow or another, even though they just seem to be in a normal box, when I opened that first bag I had a nice mix of big chips and little chips.  The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.

This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .

My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.

Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer.

However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.

1145,"This stuff is great if you're looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.<br />The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.<br /><br />Going to buy again for sure.",food
1146,"Not paying attention, I thought this product was simply vanilla extract when I purchased it, tried it in my coffee, and got a shock. Yummy!

This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I can't do it.

I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.<br /><br />Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)<br />Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)<br /><br />I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.

1164,"After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of ""real"" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it!",food

All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled.

I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!",food

1218,We had these along with Omaha prime rib. Both were great. Two where plenty to fill up. Made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes.,food
1219,"I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.",food
1220,These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these.,food
1221,"I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices.",food
1222,"January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.",food
1223,"So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.  Yum!!!",food
1224,I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck,food
1225,They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal.,food

1228,Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol.

They claim it's a lot of caffeine, but it doesn't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation!<br /><br />I highly recommend these!",food

That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!",food

Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!

1257,"After you've made the customary, authentic English trifle with Bird's custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocery-store pudding packages. I DID purchase a large quantity of Bird's custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack/container to a friend who is originally from England.<br /><br />At Christmas, I will also include a container of Bird's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non-English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Bird's custard recipe for trifle.<br /><br />English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake.

1262,I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.

1265,"I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe.<br /><br />I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.<br /><br />To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.<br /><br />Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out.",food

It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />*****",food

Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.

It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment.",food

Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by ""Alive and Aware"", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered ""Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds"", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Grr.",food

1319,"I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less ""tasty"" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product.",food
1320,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",food
1321,"This cocoa powder has a deep, fruity taste- I highly recommend it.  I recently bought a vitamix blender, which means that I now make 5 smoothies a day.

1323,This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.,food
1324,"Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.",food
1325,"This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.

1373,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",food
1374,"I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.",food
1375,"I used to use agave nectar and honey. Even though I picked organic, there was still more sugar than desired after I put in my recipes.

The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months.

Not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner.<br /><br />Of all the brands I have tried NuNaturals is the best; it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste.<br /><br />I keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when I eat out, I use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies, and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home. I keep a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out.<br /><br />I have given up all artificial sweetners.

1382,Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*,food
1383,"I hated Stevia and it's licorice taste until I tried Nustevia.  Since that day, I have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks.  I like that it is a plant based product and not bio-engineered.  No after-taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet.",food
1384,"I don't like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they don't taste good. I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter.",food
1385,"I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!",food
1386,"If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product.",food
1387,"I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended.",food

1391,"Stevia is pretty much the only natural zero-calorie sweetener there is, but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter!  Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though).",food
1392,"After years of using synthetic sweeteners like Equal and Sweet N Low, I realized their long-term effects and wanted to find a good alternative. NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase, it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good.",food
1393,"I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.<br /><br />The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging.",food
1394,"We love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything (beverages, desserts, cooking). It is not at all bitter, even in hot drinks like coffee. For baking, there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar ([...]). If you need to replace the ""bulk"" of sugar in a recipe, you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work ([...]). My kids don't notice the switch and I feel good about using it because it's all natural.",food
1395,"I am so happy I discovered this product. I had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and NuNaturals is by far the best. Virtually NO aftertaste, quick dissolving and convenient. It is also very economical at 1.5 cents a serving. I use a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly. Do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder - you'll be happy you did!",food

I was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order.",food

I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.",food

I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good.",food
1404,"NuStevia's White Stevia powder is amazing!  I have been on a low-carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and NuStevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  I love sweet things, and without them I don't think I'd have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.<br />NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.<br />I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again.",food

We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  We've been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison.",food

There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.

It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. Overall, I'd say it's fine in a pinch - these shelf-stable meals are easier to find than most - but if you have other options available, these are only fair-to-middlin'.",food

Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down.",food

I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain.

It has a really peanutty flavor that you wouldn't expect in a product containing only 3 grams of fat per serving. I would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stir-fry vegetables...I am buying a case now to test just that! The peanut flavor is strong enough that I bet it'd distribute among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you wouldn't get very saucy noodles and dry veggies.<br /><br />I recommend this product. The best-tasting peanut noodle you'll be able to find for only 3 grams of fat.,food

I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's ""standing"" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!",food
1469,"For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles.

I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean.

1497,"MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic® formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]",food

We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.

1519,"These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One-One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand-up box dispenser which is nice too.  I can't understand the other reviewer here who didn't like the coffee - I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod I've found.  Also the value here can't be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you won't be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto-delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum.",food
1520,"The flavor of these pods is horrid.  I ordered them only because Senseo was out of stock for so long, and I needed some decaf pods, and these had received a couple good reviews (which I now suspect were written by Baronet employees).  I have never tasted such awful coffee before. A big ""YUK"" for Baronet.",food
1521,"I am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering.  The strength of the coffee itself is very good.  I can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the Senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money.  Plus, it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning!",food
1522,"I had been using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YE"">Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA"">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>. Although the Senseo coffee is very good, I wanted some variety. This is what I found and its excellent. The vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly, leaves no after taste. I drink tall cups, 16 oz, so what I am doing is using 1 of each type. The vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great. The Senseo decaf is a little cheaper, so I do that as a cost saving measure. I also signed up for Subscribe and Save to further reduce cost.  If you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer, I am confident you will love this coffee.",food
1523,So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.,food

1532,"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food.",food
1533,"Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge.",food
1534,"Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving.",food

1537,"Overall, this was good, but not great.  The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star.  I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste.  I'd buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more.  I may try that egg tip!",food
1538,"The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy! The coconut and ginger flavors are very mild.<br /><br />Each recloseable, Chinese-takeout-shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container. One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there weren't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3, plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier. (Of course, one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you're not fond of it, but I like them all!)",food
1539,"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors).",food
1540,"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).<br /><br />While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.<br /><br />While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat.",food

Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says ""gluten-free"" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat/gluten.",food

1551,"I had recently tried a similar product from Trader Joe's and, not having a TJ's around me presently, I decided to try this more readily-available variation.  I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...",food
1552,I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...,food
1553,"I don't plan on reordering it, but it was definitely edible and filling since I added chicken.",food
1554,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess.",food
1555,"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just ""melt"" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan.  Then add your favorite meat and veggies.  I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies.",food
1556,"While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy.",food
1557,Much hotter than your normal green curry. One pack makes many servings.,food
1558,"Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better! Has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a good amount of heat. It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to ""spice it up"". We wish it had a lower sodium content. While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing! Really good with chicken, beef, pork, tofu and veggie dishes. Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals. We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it. Will buy again!",food
1559,"Second order.  Very good, hot which I like but best to sample as per your preferences.",food

Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills.

I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!

1574,"I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach, and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight, she slept almost all the time, and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)",food

Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.",food
1584,Wish I would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes. My 6 year old Jack Russell has always had the worst shedding problem and I recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition (was feeding her P*urina dog chow). She's only been on this dog food for two weeks and I can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding! She loves the taste and I love the price for such a good quality dog food.,food
1585,"When I purchased the Harmony Farms Healthy Weight Formula, I had a Mini Dachshund and Jack Russel Terrier.  Both of them love it.  I have added a Shih Tzu to my pack and she loves it, also.  I would highly recommend it to others.  The kibble is just the right size for small dogs.",food
1586,"The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  The other nice thing is that Target sells this brand, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you haven't ordered more in time, you can stop by Target.",food
1587,"I am very pleased with this dog food. My sheltie has a good coat and good movements with Harmony Farms. Does much better with this food than others. He is a very picky eater, so I do add chicken and he will eat. We will stick with Harmony Farms. I also like the bag, it helps keep the food fresh.",food
1588,"My dog loves this food, and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years.  The vet is very happy with her general health, coat, and teeth.  Having the 16lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific!  The 16 lb. size is not available in my area.",food
1589,"While on a family camping trip with Josh our 8yr old Golden, we ran out of dog food. Stopped at a Wegman's market in Erie PA to shop for a quality food. Settled on the Harmony Farm's chicken. Josh liked it right away.<br />We've been mixing it with his normal food (Canidae).<br />He's very healthy and playful, his coat is shiny. He's a happy pup.",food
1590,"My dog loves, loves  this dog food.I had to say love twice, because this dog food is one of his dog's favorite.",food
1591,"I have purchased this product once before from Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and in tact.  This is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at PetSmart in New York but in Arizona, it is no where to be found.  This food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all.  We try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it.  So now we go through Amazon and our dog is quite happy.  Bought a double amount to receive free shipping.  It was a very good deal.",food
1592,"I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!",food
1593,My dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through Amazon I am able to save money per pound and trips to the store. It arrives promptly and is the same quality as always. Harmony Farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods. LOVE IT!,food
1594,"I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy.",food
1595,"This dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues , as they have had with other brands.  They both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food. I have been very pleased with the automated delivery service.",food
1596,"Since I live in a rural area sometimes I'd drive to town just for dog food...needless to say that was expensive.  For $26 w/free-shipping the Harmony Farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality ""name-brands"" - my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry & flaky. I love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy.  Very thankful it's something I can afford as well.  Only wish Amazon offered a 'subscription service' for this item like they do on others.",food
1597,"I am always pleased with the variety of shopping items, that I find on Amazon.com.<br />I have never been disatified with my purchases through Amazon.com.<br />When searchomg for things, even dog food, I automatically go to Amazon.com<br />before any other site. Rarely do I chose another site.  Amazon.com<br />really rocks.  Thanks for being there!<br />J.Meadows, Syracuse, NY",food
1598,I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:),food
1599,"In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky.",food
1600,"I have 2 husky/shepherd mixes. The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up. He also wouldn't eat more than a few nibbles at a time. The 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea (vet's food didn't fix it either). He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result. They're both more relaxed.<br />We purchase at our local grocery store (Hannaford here in NY) for about $1.31/lb. For the price, ingredients, and results - you can't beat it.",food
1601,I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.,food
1602,"These chips are wonderful.  My kids and I all loved the salt and pepper.<br />Each .8 oz bag was 100 calories, lots of chips for the calorie count.",food
1603,"Great packaging, and item is just as described. Will purchase this item again. They were shipped very fast, and efficient.",food
1604,"Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture, but, I would highly recommend trying these out.",food
1605,Got this item on a one-day-only sale on Amazon.  Love having the single-serving portion as I am following WW plan.  Only 3 points plus per serving.  Tasty and on the same line as the Special K crackers.  The variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile.  Cheddar and BBQ are my favorites.  Try them...,food
1606,"I discovered Pop Chips awhile back and fell in love with the BBQ flavor- whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative. Hubby is a teacher, so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school.<br /><br />Since I mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week, I thought the variety pack would be different for him. He gets his crunchy fun and doesn't realize the Pop Chips aren't as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting. Score! Plain are fine, vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor. Single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo, but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich.",food
1607,I really liked these chips as did my entire family. I wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. I would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind.,food
1608,These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible.,food
1609,"I like these Pop Chips a lot, but not all the flavors.  This variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like.  These chips have strong flavor and are not greasy.  They are fairly filling and make a great snack.  They're pretty noisy (like most chips) so don't take 'em to the local theater!<br /><br />These came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging.  I can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as I found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things, and after several months it still tasted fine.  ;)<br /><br />These are a pretty good size for a quick snack.  Quality has been consistent over several different batches.  I really like the texture and crunch, and love the lack of greasiness.",food
1610,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks.",food
1611,"I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order.",food
1612,"I had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local Target in 3oz. bags.  I am so glad that I bought this variety pack! Not only did I discover other flavors that I enjoy, but it's single serving size so it's better for portion control.  I love popchips, and I find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips!",food
1613,I like these chips a lot! Now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i Fish!,food
1614,A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.,food
1615,"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh.",food
1616,"These are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips.  Great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty, crunchy snack.  They are light and crunchy and they taste really good. I was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good.  The original flavor reminds me a lot of the Munchos chips.  The original flavor and salt/vinegar are my favorite but they are all good.  My least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor (I don't like cheddar) but most people really like it. I have purchased these several times now and I will continue to do so.  I  highly recommend this product for anyone!",food
1617,"For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase!",food
1618,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!",food
1619,"I like all the varieties except the salt and pepper.  They taste too much like black pepper and nothing else.  The others are very goodl<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO"">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>",food
1620,"The products are wonderful and fresh!!  Everything reported about the chips is on target, and I would recommend them to others.  Amazon's services are fantastic!!",food
1621,I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.<br /><br />I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??<br /><br />Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.,food
1622,"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring.",food
1623,"I have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have I found a great choice in PopChips!  These are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips.  I love Special K cracker chips, but they only come in big bags.  I saw these and they are packaged the way I like (individual serving bags), so I gave them a try.  Now, I will never be without them!  They are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag.  Finally a good-tasting, healthier potato chip that I can enjoy!",food
1624,"I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again.",food
1625,"These chips are very tasty,  Its a nice size serving and only 100 calories.  Good grab and go snack for busy Moms",food
1626,"I agree with many of these reviews.  The product tastes good - not fantastic but good.  I don't like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.<br />Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.  Don't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips - eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).<br />If you do get the big box - just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them - and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two.",food
1627,"The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks.",food
1628,Aboulutely love Popchips!I first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in California. I like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.,food
1629,This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.,food
1630,Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!,food
1631,"I have to watch my calories, but I tend to not be very successful if the food I eat is tasteless.  I have enjoyed all six flavors of these Popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag.  My favorites are Sour Cream & Onion and the Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors.  In fact, they're so good I just want to keep eating them; and have to resist opening a second bag, because that really defeats the purpose!  I like the variety pack and it's not a bad value.",food
1632,The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.,food
1633,"I love these chips, they taste so good I am on a low cal diet and they are perfect. The individual bags keep you honest. Thank you PopChips",food
1634,These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!,food
1635,"I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite!",food
1636,These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size,food
1637,"Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar.",food
1638,A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.,food
1639,These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.,food
1640,These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.,food
1641,I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!,food
1642,"I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips, they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor.  I am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend (who hates anything that's healthy).  I recommend these to all my friends.  I'm on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all.",food
1643,"I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind,  I use the plain chips to dip with my salsa.  I would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not.",food
1644,This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.,food
1645,"Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly, but by the time the first bag as gone (I have a husband and kids), I was hooked. Wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it. Personally, I like the plain and also the salt/pepper. My kids love all of them though and, while these aren't fruit/veggies, I feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips.",food
1646,"We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with ""regular"" fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative.",food
1647,"I wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because I never ordered snacks of the internet,  so after finally decided to order it. It arrived within 3 days! the flavor is awesome! just like what I hoped for! if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you! if you are happy with the regular potato chips and doesn't care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are! those chips have so much flavor! they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor! I have lived in the U.K. for a while and one thing I have always missed is the crisps that I used to eat in U.K. those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps! I will be order those again!",food
1648,"I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online.",food
1649,"I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said, Pop Chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Salt & Vinegar by far.<br /><br />The calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair!",food
1650,Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY!,food
1651,"I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the ""Food Should Taste Good"" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well.",food
1652,The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.,food
1653,These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.,food
1654,"To those of you, and there's a lot of us, who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intake,these chips are A-1 in my book.<br /><br />First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.<br /><br />I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.<br /><br />They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.<br /><br />So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1 - 2 bags a day!!!<br /><br />They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.<br /><br />So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends/family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.<br /><br />Hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackers!!!!!<br /><br />Keep on Munching, the Healthy way with ""POPCHIPS"" snacks.",food
1655,"Found these while looking for good, cheap, low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office.

I'm so excited!<br /><br />Gotta have my pop chips...",food
1656,My husband and I both really like the popchips.  They are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying.,food
1657,"I read a reference to these on Jillian Michaels's website, checked out the Popchips web page, and liked everything I read. But the proof is in the tasting, of course. They arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that Popchips are incredible. They taste SINFULLY good, crunchy and just yummy. I love sea salt and vinegar chips in general, and truly LOVED the popchips version. Anyone on Weight Watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",food
1658,What a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track.  These are very tasty and crunchy - great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves.,food
1659,"My whole family loves these ""chips"".  I am following the Weight Watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points, there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it!!!",food
1660,"i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks. my friend told  me about pop chips that she bought from amazon. she said she loved them and i should give them a try, i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good. and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack",food
1661,"The only complaint I have with pop chips is that I can't get all of the flavors at the stores where I live!!! My husband and I both LOVE pop chips, his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion.  Pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake!!!! We cannot say enough good things about them!",food
1662,"I LOVE PopChips.  They have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste.  They are very similar to munchos--very light and fluffy.  If you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving, these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories.",food
1663,The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own<br />The salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.  Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories<br />The sour cream and onion is a little chemicall-y but decent.<br />The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.  The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture.<br /><br />Haven't yet tried the other two flavors.  Will update as I do.<br /><br />If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.  Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.<br /><br />So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.  These definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.,food
1664,"I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means ""low salt.""",food
1665,"Popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. They are clean, light, deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavors.They would make a great lunch box addition. Popchips will be on hand in our home from now on!",food
1666,I received my box of assorted Popchips a few days ago to support my Weight Watcher meal plan.  I absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan.  Without hesitation I recommend all varieties of these chips.  What a great idea!!!,food
1667,"Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips..",food
1668,"What a great snack!  I love these crispy, crunchy, treats.  Packaged in a single serve bag, I buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so I have them on hand whenever I feel the urge to snack.<br />Unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than I had anticipated.  Time to order some more!  All the different flavors are seasoned just right--not too salty or spicy.  I love Popchips!",food
1669,"These chips are awesome. The light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack. I am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice. Gives me that salty, crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day. I love them. I have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them. I haven't tried all the flavors yet, only those in the variety pack but trust me I will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite. That may be difficult they are all so good!!!",food
1670,"I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through.",food
1671,We absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from Amazon we were able to find them in Target.  They have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren't trying to loose weight.  Recommended by weight watchers.,food
1672,"Popchips are absolutely delicious, and getting the variety pack is great.  Everyone in my family has a favorite flavor.  Highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving, but are not nearly as bad for you as chips.",food
1673,I really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat.  I especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar.  I don't care for the salt and pepper.  I wish I could get a multipack and choose the flavors I want.,food
1674,We have played this with three adults.  fun game that does not take too long to play.  makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans.,food
1675,That's all I can say. Yum at a great price! I can't find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome.,food
1676,"Great low cal snack... satisfies the crunchy, snacky, salty cravings without high calories.  All flavors are good;  The cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste.",food
1677,"I have a free sampling of these chips and I can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. They remind me of Munchos, but are less greasy. Try them.",food
1678,If you haven't discovered Pop Chips yet - you don't know what you are missing.  Low calorie and high in flavor.  Great for the kids lunches. I need the single servings or I will eat the whole big bag.,food
1679,"I am so happy to try and enjoy pop-chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com, products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious, they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family.",food
1680,"These have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt, and or sugar.  They have texture and flavor, and a bag hits the spot.  I would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines.",food
1681,"I LOVE Popchips!!  These are the BEST.  Individual serving bags, flavors are great, taste is excellent.  My daughter and grandson love the barbeque.  I have found that buying them through Amazon is cheaper and Amazon offers the bigger bags also.  I have to watch that because I could eat the whole bag.",food
1682,"I am a chip fanatic, when I heard of these, I HAD to give them a try! They are very tasteful esp. the bbq one's.  I have yet to try the other flavors but I am sure they will not disappoint.  I watch my weight/health so these are perfect, just becareful because they are addicting!",food
1683,"Good Variety of the flavors, makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer. Also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack.",food
1684,This is a great snack to have instead of potato chips. Lower in calories but still delicious. Will be ordering them again.,food
1685,"I was very pleased with the popchips.  MY first order was before the chips hit the stores.  The taste is delightful.  No greasy taste. In fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited!  Amazing how it is made.  Calorie count is great too! I went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them.  My third order I placed for a gathering of 12 friends.  They too, could not get over the variety of flavors and how they were made. I feel the product itself won over more prospective customers. Try it yourself, I know you will be very pleased.<br /><br />Trish Kowalski",food
1686,I love Popchips. They are delicious and I can't believe one bag is only 100 calories. The flavors are great although I am not a fan of salt and pepper. I would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors. I am sure you will love them too.,food
1687,"I hate healthy anything!<br /><br />But I am overweight, so I need an alternative to my normal routine of Doritos potato chips. The only reason I tried these chips is because of the other reviews, so I am contributing my 5 stars toward the product.<br /><br />From just looking at it, I was expecting it to taste more like rice cake... but I was pleasantly surprise. The chips tastes great, very crisp... I don't really know how to explain it.<br /><br />All the flavors are great. My favorite is the BBQ. The Original is a bit too salty, but still very tasty.<br /><br />Highly recommended! At least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack.",food
1688,"I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!  These Popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. Though I don't really care for the pepper flavor, I like all of the others.  I will buy these again.",food
1689,I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didn't know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case!,food
1690,"These taste great and are a healthier alternative. My favorite was the sea salt and vinegar. I probably won't order the other flavors again since I have a favorite, and don't eat potato chips all that often. But the variety pack was great to get to try them all.",food
1691,"These are great - my entire family loves them.  It is a great addition to my son's school lunch - and I have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal ""chip"" out on the market.  Great flavor - BBQ and Sourcream & Onion are our favorites!  Love the single serve bags - wish you could buy them at the store - but for now I will continue to purchase on Amazon...  because of the great service and varieties!",food
1692,These chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried. I love love the bbq flavor.  I also like how the chips don't crumble in the bag.,food
1693,These are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal.,food
1694,"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!",food
1695,Popchips are very good.  The varity received lets you try the diferent flavors.  I only wish I could find them locally.,food
1696,"These are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake.  You get a lot of chips for minimal calories, and they taste great!!",food
1697,"Great selection of chips & very fresh. If you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips & don't like the fake taste of baked, these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. I bought 2 cases & every time I'm at Target or our Super Box Store I make sure to pick them up!!",food
1698,"I agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options.  The texture of the chips is great and they're very flavorful!  I can certainly taste the sodium but if this isn't a problem for you, I would recommend trying them.  It's a snack I look forward to having a chance to enjoy.  Everyone has their favorite flavor (i'm no exception -BBQ FTW!) so I recommend trying the variety pack first.  I thought I'd have at least one or two flavors we'd 'hate', but no.<br /><br />My initial purchase of an alternative snack was Stacy's Pita Chips in Parmesan Garlic & Herb.  Nothing against them, but they lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.  These Popchips are exactly right.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty, flavorful snack!",food
1699,"I loved these chips. They were exactly what I had been looking for. They are not fried/greasy or baked/dry they were great-tasting, satisfying, and healthy alternative to regular potato chips. You can feel good about eating these chips. Can't say enough, you'll have to try them for yourself! I am ordering more now!",food
0,There are 2 separate areas with arm chairs and TV for relaxing and working the other with other arm chairs PC computer TV bar and sitting area. There are newspapers and magazines also some airline magazines. Decoration is fresh and modern. It is clean and well maintained. Bottled drinks coffee machine cheese and salad sandwiches and sweets. This is a very small airport serving about 20 flights a day and the lounge is fine and over the quality of other airlines I visited in the past. If they provide a better coffee machine and a wider choice of snacks it would be quite an interesting lounge to relax.,lounge
1,"It is a small, dark, windowless lounge located on the 3rd floor, accessible via elevator. The bar is well equipped with soft drinks, coffee, wines and biers.",lounge
2,Both of the lounges have the same food (sandwiches yogurt cheese cheese pie fruits) and beverages (all sorts of coffee tea  bottled drinks alcoholic drinks  Greek wine) .The decoration in Thessaloniki is very stylish and the bathroom too . Athens is nice but probably needs to be updated.,lounge
3,The lounge was clean and the decor is up to date with colourful chairs. Only one PC and mainly empty bar. Food is some sandwiches cheese and nuts. A lot needs to be improved. I went to Lufthansa lounge where hot food was provided.,lounge
4,Big and spacious lounge. Comfy sofas and a nice variety of food/drinks. The lounge was recently refurbished and looks very stylish. stuff very friendly and they let you know when your flight starts boarding.,lounge
5,Surprisingly pleasant lounge. If traveling through Greece Thessaloniki makes a much better transfer point than Athens and this lounge was quite comfy and pleasant. The shuttle from the lounge to our flight is nice. Aegean Airlines was a pleasant host on our trip to Greece.,lounge
6,"Large well lit lounge with a separate smoking area. It can be crowded at times but it is still relatively quiet unless somebody starts screaming into hes/her cell phone. Sandwiches ice cream cheese peanuts and croissants are always there and the bar is so so (no champagne!) with good espresso. Three computers are available and lately free Wi-fi is also provided. Relatively comfortable ""wire"" seats are available at round tables but if one sits at one of the sofas the risk of falling asleep is high. Careful lots of walking to some gates (especially B1 and 2) and sometimes lengthy security screen is after the lounge. Overall though a good lounge.",lounge
7,Nice spacious area. Wifi is fine. Quiet. Self-serve food and bar area but limited offering for food. For breakfast - cereals and Danish. Staffing need some schooling on customer service a smile goes a long way but no-one was cracking even a small grin. No direction on the layout.,lounge
8,Paid £50 for Are Lingus Lounge use for myself and my daughter on way to New York from Belfast via Dublin Airport. Couldn't believe such poor food offer at breakfast time. 3 cereals in plastic dispensers and a shared bowl of fruit salad to cater for everyone. Some small croissants only and not nice taste at that. Nothing else. Also poor reception from staff. What a rip off.,lounge
9,Much nicer lounge than the old terminal 1. There was lots of light from the floor to ceiling windows and good views of the runaway. However the choice of food (we were there 9-10.30am) was very limited: cereals croissants cheese and crackers. No bread or porridge. However the coffee was decent and if you really fancied it there was a good choice of alcohol.,lounge
10,On return to UK visited Aer Lingus lounge. Clean and pleasant enough. Limited facilities and far from gates buried somewhere in terminal 2. At 25euros per person it is very poor value.,lounge
11,Regularly used this lounge in the past year always found it good used it Saturday 5th October and what a change for the worse no longer provide sandwiches (told they can't find a supplier by one of the staff) so lukewarm soup and brown bread all that was available. No small bottles of sparking water only big bottles that had been opened all day gone flat. A woman told me in bad English that they have stopped the bottles of sparkling water as the airline loses revenue on onboard sales. Felt the whole experience was a let down. Aer Lingus you've done better in the past this is terrible.,lounge
12,"Surly and unfriendly receptionists . On my Aer Lingus prestige my wife and I were permitted entry but told my two young children would not be allowed in. Never experienced that in a Gold Circle. So we sat outside and went in to get refreshments. They then watched us and it felt like we were being ""watched"" the entire time. Not even a great lounge. Very budget.",lounge
13,"The Oasis lounge seems to be shared amongst all the users of T4 at JFK. I didn't see any other lounges. Because of that lack of competition it seems that the staff are just not bothered. The ""welcome"" is perfunctory at best and at worst is really an entitlement check after whether the staff lose interest in the passenger. Signage is poor no times/distances to various gates no advertising other facilities to passengers. Trying to plug in an iPhone charger was tricky as the first 2 sockets I found were both broken exposing the innards of the socket wiring. Seating in the quiet area was not very comfortable. All in all I wouldn't be rushing back.",lounge
14,Showers toilets decent range of snacks and drinks together with newspapers and mags. It is bright and airy and has a quite zone.,lounge
15,Bright and spacious lounge. Drink and food selection reasonable but not brilliant. It is on two levels I would choose the upper level as the views are better but food choice slightly better downstairs.,lounge
16,I used this lounge for a 9.55am departure. It was not very busy but was claustrophobic. The staff were welcoming and seemed happy to play with a passenger's toddler. The seating could do with a good clean. Food limited - cereal cheap cheese and biscuits and even cheaper croissants. As a Gold Circle member I had free entry - but if you have to pay don't bother.,lounge
17,The new lounge spans two floors with views of the apron A water feaTUre dominates one wall. There are work stations and complimentary wifi. The range of food on offer during the early morning is sufficient and a bar service is available. This lounge has own showers and washrooms something the former lounge lacked. The lounge is also open to non FFP members for a 25euro fee.,lounge
18,Sitting here now kicking myself that I bought a day pass. Absolutely the most dismal depressing miserable lounge. In a windowless bunker. Shoddy uncomfortable furniture inedible old sandwiches indifferent attendant. I guess the troubles in Ireland filter down to their Airport lounges.,lounge
19,Ample seating including armchairs and full-length recliners. Complimentary WiFi and a number of booths to work on your laptop along with three or four PCs (with very old software!). Staff helpful and courteous. Bar has a selection of hot and cold drinks including soft drinks and alcohol. A limited selection of hot food. Large selection of newspapers.,lounge
20,Not to the same standard as other lounges (eg. Amsterdam) but actually pretty good. Staff (when they're there) are nice and the lounge has a nice little selection of food and drink and free internet (although fair play to cork it's free throughout the airport). My only issue with cork is that it doesn't open until i think something like 6:00 although the flight to amsterdam leaves at 6:10. As with their other lounges no toilets although this doesn't really bother me that much.,lounge
21,I'm sitting in the lounge a bit incredulous that I paid for access to this. I paid for it because I had a lot of time to kill and it seemed a good way to pass the day. What a gloomy awful lounge. I found this page because I was looking to see if maybe I'd missed something because it seems there is no free WiFi. Completely insane. I thought this was for business travellers? The girl at the desk looked me up and down when I walked in too so apparently despite having a lounge that looks like a 3rd grade classroom without the fun stuff on the walls (or windows) they have a problem with how people dress? I'm neatly attired but I'm flying today so I am absolutely not wearing a suit. Anyway the long and short of it is that the lounge is unfriendly no amenities no toilets no natural light can't really see myself bothering with it again.,lounge
22,My first visit to the Gold Circle lounge in many months. I was aware from other reviews of the decrease in size but I didn't expect to see the work stations gone too. The only saving grace is that there is a choice of breads and pastries in the morning.,lounge
23,The range of food and beverages is reasonable. The main attraction of this lounge is that it is beside boarding gates. This evening I noticed the red wine bottle was empty. I asked the attendant to replace it but she wasn't able to open the new bottle. I can understand a bottle of wine being used but to have a staff member unable to open another is beyond belief. What used to be a very good lounge has become almost a joke.,lounge
24,The Gold Circle Lounge at EI home airport of Dublin has just been cut in size by around two thirds. Only a corner of the old lounge remains and the rest has been transformed into a staff room. Rather typical of EI really - an airline that typically seems to put staff ahead of customers. What remains of the lounge is mostly hard airport style seating. Not very must when we visited. Limited selection of drinks. Nice cookies. Glasses were very old and a little too dirty to use. Not convenient to most of EI's departure gates (10 min walk and then backtrack + 10 more minutes).,lounge
25,I have posted previous comments on Aer Lingus lounges but nothing prepared me for the filthy tip that is Chicago Gold Circle lounge. Its tiny dirty furniture all stained ceiling was all stained. Drinks okay no food not even a cracker. I don't normally fly biz class with EI and judging by the reviews and the state of the lounges I never will.,lounge
26,I got to use the Aer Lingus lounge as I was flying on Icelandair. This has got to be the pokiest grubbiest lounge I have ever seen or used. The food was soggy and not fresh and the decor is not very good. Gives a feeling of boredom and gloom. Aer Lingus needs to brighten this lounge up a lot. The lady there was nice and friendly - she was the best part about this lounge.,lounge
27,This lounge has so much potential - it's bright clean and offers sweeping views of the airfield. However the desk staff can range from super-friendly (letting me bring my kids in sometimes) to totally indifferent (too busy gossiping with colleagues to say hello). There is a good range of drinks on offer but food is poor and is restricted to bags of twiglets (does anyone actually like them??!) and crackers with DUTCH cheese (so much for strong Irish brand identity which Aer Lingus supposedly prides itself on). Plus there is a charge for internet usage which is a shame.,lounge
28,Very basic but better than filthy overcrowded terminal. Food choice limited to biscuits and packaged cheddar cheese. Good selection of drinks - alcoholic and non. Staff friendly to indifferent depending on when you visit. Washrooms outside lounge - shared with other lounges and filthy.,lounge
29,Excellent lounge with good selection of food drink and newspapers. Wifi access etc. I suspect that the high standards are not down to Aer Lingus as the lounge is shared with a number of major international airlines. I say this because the Aer Lingus exclusive lounges at Dublin (home base) and London Heathrow are extremely poor by comparison. Their lounges at Chicago O'Hare and Boston are amongst the worse I have ever encountered.,lounge
30,"Everyone agrees that this lounge beats sitting in the awful ""tube"" outside but that's about it. Aer Lingus you need to incorporate free WiFi some food e.g sandwiches or whatever and get some toilets in there. This is as another user points out barely worth the trouble of keeping up Gold Circle Membership for.",lounge
31,"Air France lounge spacious without being nice, just practical. Breakfast consisted of croissants and some other food. On the Asian side different filled pastries and instant noodles. Plenty of fresh fruit also available. Alcohol and wine bar fully stocked already, even if it was 8 am and serve yourself as much as you want. Fine relaxing lounge with all you can wish for.",lounge
32,"The Galaxy Lounge at the E-Terminal looks a bit dated. It is a large and very open space. Enough different seating arrangements. A separate space for computers. And a food and drinks counter. Due to the open space one can hear almost every conversation. To make things worse they play loud music. Food is ok. Enough choice but not much of a display. Drinks are also ok. Enough choice. Alcohol you have to ask (except beer). WiFi speed is great and free. Shower room is a strange affair. You get a 'space towel' and some slippers. If you don't bring your own shampoo and/or soap, you are left with only water to wash yourself. The towel is a big paper cloth you can dispose of after the shower. Slippers have the same design. You don't enter this space for a spa treatment, but it does refresh. If you have to sit here for a long time this will not be a relaxing experience.",lounge
33,Small lounge with not enough comfortable chairs. No english or international reading material. Wifi works well. Food of very poor quality and boring. Was surely not impressed by this lounge but have visited worse in my life.,lounge
34,Aeroflot Galaxy Galaktica Sirius Classic Jazz and Blues Lounges in SVO. Access while travelling on business require invitation card from transfer desk but happened smoothly. In SVO you are semi-free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. I prefer the newest Galaktica (=Galaxy) in terminal E Classic in terminal F and Blues in terminal D. Other lounges like Sirius in E and Jazz in D (a parallel or copy of Blues) must wait for another time (Sirius is a special lounge at terminal E - only for disabled – it is virtually a requirement for entering!). Drinks plenty – up to medium quality. Lounge hopping not always possible - even by use of SKY-gold card. Lounges prefer you stay at the lounges at departing gate but it depends on staff. Galaktika is the best of all of those I know big and smart design and colourful orange furniture with good business and smoking sections – further it has views to and outside airport. Other lounges do not have views. Views are much better from the commercial areas outside the lounges. Food is bread oriented but heating of croissants sandwiches bread rolls are possible. Some lounges (at least Classic) sells quality hot food at an additional price like a restaurant within the lobby. Showers fine but scarce.,lounge
35,The reception turned me back to a transit desk for lounge invitation. Then I was turned again to a transit lounge nearby where I finally got the invitation printed out. Due to transit I was entitled to a lounge in terminal F (Sheremyetevo Classic) but remembering its poor dungeon-like conditions I sneaked into the Galactica - offering more space and windows. Food - only cold snacks (potato chips crackers peanuts bread with cheese bread with some sausage etc). Drinks - range of soft drinks and alcohol. Free WiFi. Lounge quite clean toilets inside shower room and smoking room under construction. On the way to the gate entered Sheremyetevo Classic lounge to find it has been refurbished - larger (but still much smaller than Galactica) completely renovated. Food the same in both lounges but I've noticed champagne available in the Classic. A smoking room inside available.,lounge
36,Aeroflot used CX's The Wing lounge before so I was worried a bit about the new one. The Traveller's is not as airy and spacy as The Wing however well equipped and nice too. Many warm options for breakfast and free access to the alcohol bar. Just 2 showers (so you have to wait for your turn) maintained well and clean. Overall okay experience with good food and drinks.,lounge
37,A throwback to the old Soviet era - except that they have 3 PCs with Internet access. The food is pretty bad: couple of bread rolls - but where is the margarine? Newspapers and magazines are all Russian - yet this lounge is for all Skyteam airlines. Bathrooms aren't clean. Sofas are pretty comfortable but there's no window view. A couple of television sets that are running the same damn Russian TV channel.,lounge
38,Oh dear nothing changes here! Not allowed into the lounge until 2 hours before flight despite having a 5 hour layover. Once in the lounge you wonder what the wait was for. No natural light lounge arrange in 3 areas all rather dark and at peak times impossible to find a seat. The food is poor to say the least and staff at beverage counter seem reluctant to offer drinks! There are some PCs at one end but very variable connection and not very useful. Small toilet area no showers - all in all a disgrace for a SkyTeam member airline.,lounge
39,It took a long walk and searching to arrive at the Premier International lounge after mistakenly entering the Domestic one in Terminal 2. There seems to be a shortage of cool air in the public areas of the terminal and the Business Lounge did not provide a relief at that point. Air seems to be in short supply here and was replenished every twenty minutes which seemed to be a long time when the indoor temperature reached 80F. The lounge is spacious with food offering that included: stale sandwiches good mini cheese cakes a good variety of packaged sweet and salty snacks cold drinks and unrefrigerated “iced” tea. Computers for usage was complimentary.,lounge
40,I am writing this review as I sit in the lounge. Door understaffed & young man at desk very obviously nicer to male clients than myself as a solo middle aged woman. Lounge is poorly set up rather like a bus station where toomany travellers require seats for their bags & coats. Food selection is the worst I've seen in a lounge. Drinks selection is better but they sure do not hurry to put out the bubbly. The latest empty has been sitting on a counter for a half hour now. In general lots of empties left around to point some travellers are clearing up instead. Wifi works well at least.,lounge
41,Very nice used it late in the night so not too many people. Nice selection of liquors and spirits. No food (only snacks as pastries some fruit granola peanuts and crackers) as their policy is to serve food only during Mexican meal times (7-9 am 2-4 pm 8-10pm). They have a wine club (paying customers) with excellent sandwiches. Nice selection of local newspapers but they should add some international newspapers and magazines. They have showers toilets video games section for kids internet area free wifi. Staff friendly and professional.,lounge
42,Fairly basic lounge. Nice enough but a little crowded. Good selection of self serve alcohol and soft drinks. No real food beyond peanuts and stuff. Decent wireless and 4-6 internet terminals. Overall pretty nice for Tijuana.,lounge
43,Mexico City's new terminal 2 was barely up and running when I flew out on a Copa Airlines flight that gave me access to the Aeromexico lounge. The lounge is upstairs and is light elegant and airy albeit with no windows onto the tarmac. Comfy seating a separate computer area wifi throughout and attractive palm trees add a festive air. There is a circular bar that was unmanned during my visit plus a smaller self-service bar with an excellent selection of drinks and classy snacks. There is a separate screened-off TV lounge and another wine bar at the back for paying customers only. Since the lounge was brand-new it was obvious an effort was being made to impress. It will be important to monitor progress as time passes to see if the high standard in maintained.,lounge
44,I wouldn't really call it a business class lounge. Its basically just seats in a bar that are reserved for Business Class passengers. There are no free refreshments and although there are a wide range of drinks and snacks available they are all quite expensive.,lounge
45,Somewhat small this is the single airport lounge at Almaty Airport what I believe services all airlines. Seating areas ok small bar and food counter to one side. I could not get my laptop to access any wifi. There was a computer station with internet access at one end of the room but the airport staff seemed to be using this when I visited! A small bathroom area 2 Tv's but not much else.,lounge
46,"The lounge in Vienna that is open for Flyniki and Air Berlin flights is quite good. Nice range of breakfast stuff. (cheese, ham, marmelade), nice coffee range, some cereals, fresh fruit. The staff in the lounge is friendly and attentive. ",lounge
47,Surprised at complete lack of lounge when flying Air Berlin out of Berlin. Because of the need to get transfer passport control and security check at gate you really have no option and then you're in a space too small for the number of people bad wifi inadequate lighting dirty and 1 food vendor as the only amenity. This business class lounge experience was quite surprising. Once I was on-board the experience was great but the departure experience will keep me from connecting through Berlin again.,lounge
48,"Travellers are warned that the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary Intl Airport is undergoing construction. Based on our visit, this is an understatement. We visited the lounge in mid-July 2015 to be greeted by an experience of very poor seating, meagre food offerings and overcrowding. Even restrooms were only limitedly available, due to cleaning which went on for quite some time. In some cases, an airport may offer venues so peaceful and reasonable that it pays to visit them instead of using the airline lounge. The Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary international exemplifies a second situation where the lounge is so inadequate and overcrowded that even poor airport venues make for a better place to wait for flights. Lounge personnel here were more interested in surfing the Internet than assisting airline customers with questions about connections or required services.",lounge
49,"A nice lounge, with nice view of the tarmac. 2 soups on choice, Dips, as well as salads and sandwiches. Self serve soft drinks and alcohol. Have a kid zone, business center. I can see it can be crowded. Only accessible via elevators. No stairs. So take extra time before leaving the lounge to get to your gate. Better than any Delta, American, United lounges. Still weaker than average premium lounge in Europe.",lounge
50,The terminal is under renovation and as a result it was difficult to find the entrance to the Air Canada business class lounge. The seating in the lounge was okay (we spent a couple of hours there) but the food and the Air Canada staff were poor at best.,lounge
51,Having flow out of T2 twice on Eva Air recently this review covers both visits. Eva use the Air Canada lounge along with a couple of other Star Alliance carriers. It is close (2-3 minutes) to the boarding gates but suffers like some others on T2 in that it's a fair hike from immigration to the gates/lounge. One inside it is very modern and comfortable with a nice bar and service good range of food and good personal space. Travelling on a Wednesday evening there were not many people in the lounge and it felt quite and comfortable. A vast improvement on the old T3 lounge shared with SAS.,lounge
52,Worst lounge we have ever seen. Food buffet was almost empty and dirty and not filled up within hours. Washrooms very dirty. Noisy. Disappointing experience.,lounge
53,"Air Canada has made significant improvements in most of its lounges and they are obvious with the upgrade in service and food selection being noticeable. Gone are the days of dirty dishes and rude staff. It has been a welcome improvement. Unfortunately the YYZ MLL International lounge at the E gates seems to have been left behind. On the day I used it it was very busy with limited food offered and an unpleasant ambience. There are just too many people using the lounge many of whom have access because of their frequent flyer status. The end result is that pax who are flying on the expensive long haul flights in business class receive a mediocre experience. It's time for AC to divide the lounge into two sections one for the true international business class and ""Super Elite"" status pax and the other for the basic ""Elite"" pax and those flying on shorter route Rouge Premium. Provide a quiet area with better food for the first group and keep the current set up for the second group. My biggest wish is for AC to provide decent wifi access in its Canadian lounges. I have had better wifi access in ""developing"" world airports.",lounge
54,Now seated in lounge after a two week trip with time spent in other business class lounges Think Toronto maple leaf lounge is one of the worst we have visited Have visited this lounge often but prompted to finally share my thoughts with other travellers as the offering of a few salad items chilli Con carne and stale bread receives a failing grade Air Canada's food is consistently weaker than other competitors.,lounge
55,Very comfortable and nicely decorated lounge with small but high quality food and drinks selection. Plenty of seating space and some proper tables and chairs to dine at rather than just sofas everywhere. Nice place.,lounge
56,This is the worst lounge. Bathrooms dirty and over flowing trash minimal lounge areas and NO BAR. They don't have a liquor license. All this at a time when the terminal at LAX is under renovation and offers minimal services. I can't believe a first class lounge could be so bad.,lounge
57,I visit this Lounge six times a year in the pass few years. In my every visit the feelings are more or less the same in average except the food choices is very disappointing only cup cakes vegetables and cold boiled eggs. I have never encounter of any hot food nor hot soup in this lounge. Asian instant noodle is never seen here. My wife even prefer to sit outside in those paid cafe to have proper eating.,lounge
58,Worst lounge we have ever experienced poor service no food except crackers and cheese. Our flight was late and did not leave till 2:30 am the lounge closed at 11:30 pm. The seating was very uncomfortable bar only had very cheap wines that were free. Overall it was awful.,lounge
59,"I am always pretty pleased with the Air Canada Lounges (Vancouver is very good and so is Edmonton). Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a 35 minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first 15minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave. Again - it looks great but it is tougher if you are in a hurry. Staff still very courteous.",lounge
60,After a very long walk from check in through security and then into T2B (this is the terminal adjacent to the new Terminal 2 at Heathrow where Air Canada has its arrival/departure operations) we finally arrived at the Lounge; access is by elevator (lift) from the departure terminal gates to an upper floor. We found way finding signage lacking in this brand new terminal and directions to Air Canada's ML Lounge were no exception. We were absolutely exhausted by this time and looking forward to settling in for lunch before our 3 p.m. flight to YUL. The Lounge was very large and of course brand new. Seating was plentiful and the menu selection was excellent with a complete self-serve bar. There was a chef preparing various cooked meals however we just helped ourselves to more lighter fare as we knew we would be having lunch/supper on the flight in a few hours. Washrooms were excellent with private toilets and showers. There was also a business centre which we did not use n or did we use WiFi as it was not secure. We would definitely access this lounge again now that we know where it is.,lounge
61,vMy spouse and I were flying to LHR via YUL on Premium Economy fares so we were able to purchase Maple Leaf (ML) access for the day of our travel. This is a relatively new Lounge in Winnipeg's James Richardson International Airport which opened a new terminal in 2011. The Lounge is easy to find near Gate 9. Staff were not particularly friendly and just verified our boarding passes without comment. We got seating window-side and helped ourselves to beverages and breakfast prior to our flight to YUL. All amenities and services were very good and seating is plentiful and comfortable.,lounge
62,After a long and frustrating process getting through customs and security after our flight from LHR we were looking forward to accessing the domestic terminal ML Lounge before our next two flights home. As usual it was a challenge finding the Lounge and the few Air Canada employees we talked to just grunted and pointed to another annex of the domestic terminal to its location - still not clear. We walked a considerable distance from our departure gate to somewhere near Gate 2 to access the Lounge. We were greeted by the same indifference from Lounge staff we experienced in our previous three ML Lounge visits in our trip to the UK; our boarding passes were scrutinized and handed back to us without comment. We walked into a somewhat small lounge with dated furniture passengers lounging about everywhere (this was about 6:30 p.m.) and almost every seat occupied. We finally found a couple of hard chairs in the walkway between the window seats and airline-style gate seats in th e back of the Lounge. We went to the self-serve food area only to find it barely stocked mostly with appetizers. Very disappointing. We were looking forward to proper meal as we knew we would not get any food service on our two upcoming flights through to YWG. The washrooms were dirty dated and in poor condition (broken panels towels all over the place). The overall condition of this Lounge appeared to be one of neglect or indifference. This would not make a very good impression on AC's frequent travellers or international business travellers. We finished up as soon as we could and left for our gate. We looked for a comment card but could not find one and Lounge staff were busy with other passengers. By this time there was almost just standing room.,lounge
63,After a very long walk from Gate 5 to Gate 52 we finally found the Maple Leaf Lounge in the International area of the YUL terminal. We found way finding signage in YUL to be barely adequate and that is being generous. This also held true for finding this Lounge. Staff were polite but not overly friendly; they just checked our boarding passes and handed them back without even making eye contact. We entered a large brightly lit lounge but could not find a window table; we had to settle for a table in the computer area. As we had a three-hour wait before departing for YUL we had a good lunch of soup sandwiches salads and beverages. Menu selection was varied. Seating was comfortable and washrooms were clean. WiFi is available but not secure. There was a good selection of newspapers and magazines. We would definitely access this lounge again.,lounge
64,EVA use the Air Canada Lounge in the new Terminal 2. A very nice airy new lounge at the new Terminal. It was very quiet when I was there 19;00-21:00 there was ample hot/cold food. the lounge is nice and bright/airy. |There is a bar tender which in itself is not a problem but sometimes there was a wait while they were out clearing tables or taking orders. All in all a vast improvement than the old lounge that was used in Terminal 3.,lounge
65,We visited the Air Canada transborder Lounge on the 14th of Sept. We were very pleased with the service and facilities offered. We had a long lay over and enjoyed both the breakfast and lunch offered. A variety of beverages were available. The lounge was very clean and roomy.,lounge
66,BRU-YUL-SFO. We went out of our way to fly Air Canada back home from Europe. Had a 6-hour layover in Montreal which was nice. Easy access to the lounge staff speaks English and French (and possibly some other languages) quite fluently. Food in the lounge was not up to par (about 900 ml of cold pasta salad and some other similarly sized items were available for everybody). I went downstairs to the Burger King. Other than that however the internet is fast and functional there is a television and a wide selection of alcoholic beverages in an open-bar format. Not the best lounge but certainly not the worst.,lounge
67,I arrived at this lounge and it was hard to find a seat. the food was horrible. Empty hot meal trays just nacho chips salad and dips. Molsen beer tap was broken wine selection of one white and one red.,lounge
68,The lounge of transhipment for flights to the United States. provides appropriate care. The Buffett is very good tasty including wide range of drinks. Wi Fi works and is fast. There are several workstation. The furniture is beautiful. In the room you stay comfortable all the time. A proper and respectful service with passengers. If you option Air Canada deserves to be prestigious.,lounge
69,The Maple Leaf Lounge in the International Section of Terminal 1 at Toronto's Pearson Airport is a pleasant lounge with lots of seating. The lounge has a good selection of drinks but the food selection is much less than what one gets in Europe or Asia. I was in the lounge in the evening (after 8:00pm) and they had noodles and a cold salad. They may have had soup as well. Cookies were available. The beverage supply is large and self serve. There are three Air Canada (Maple Leaf) Lounges at Toronto's Pearson Airport Terminal 1 one domestic one International and one for flights to the U.S. This review is for the international lounge which is used for Air Canada and Star Alliance members. In terms of layout and aesthetics this is a very pleasant lounge. It has a business area lots of seating showers and eating areas with big screen tvs. The newspaper and magazibne supply is huge The airport has free wifi; I'm not sure if the lounge has separate wifi. Most of the staff seem to be there to clean up rather than to help customers but the lounge is kept clean and front desk staff are fine. The view of the planes from this lounge is limited but it is a nice place to relax.,lounge
70,"Have visited this lounge in the ""rock wall"" in the domestic area several times over the past few years this visit in March 2014 I noticed that the food selection had improved. I was there at 8am on a Friday morning for 1.5 hrs and aside from the usual cold cereal hot oatmeal make your own toast small muffins/pastries and fruit there was a covered hot container with small omelets hash browns and large home fries. The coffee machines are wonderful offering mochas  lattes cappuccinos etc. Also hot chocolate. The serving dishes were kept filled and there was someone going around picking up used plates/cups etc frequently. The lounge seemed very clean as well as the women's washroom. The lounge is large and was about 1/4-1/3 full all the time I was there. Good selection of newspapers and lots of different magazines. Wifi seemed to work fine the little I used it. Great view of the continuous action out on the tarmac!",lounge
71,I have a Priority Pass and on my way from CPT to BOS via LHR I had about 5 hours to kill. I thought I would use the lounge airside but after a 12 hour flight I wanted a shower and a light breakfast. This Air Canada Arrivals was heaven sent. It is just outside the arrivals hall to the left. Please watch out for signs because it is quite tricky to find. Once you are there the small but cosy lounge welcomes you with open arms. Good hot and cold food plus good coffee or tea a shower (very refreshing) and comfortable seats. Small if the place is crowded but at 8am it was very quiet.,lounge
72,My first experience of YYZ's T1 Domestic lounge got off to a bad start as the agent at the desk was engaged in a scintillating conversation with another agent regarding the closest gas stations to their homes. She never made eye contact offered any sort of welcome and simply handed back my boarding pass without so much as a thank you. Thanks Air Canada for making me feel like a valued customer! The lounge itself is attractive well groomed has ample seating and moderately appealing food choices. A far cry from the catering one would find in Star Alliance lounges in Europe or Asia but not bad by North American (United for example) standards.,lounge
73,Wow a bad terminal in a horrible airport with a terrible lounge. Small poor food poor seating tiny and overall as far as international lounges a real disappointment. The Starbucks on main level is much better.,lounge
74,The quality of internet access that the lounge offers is a joke. They expect Star Alliance Gold customers to pay $3.99 to use the internet because the free service they offer cannot even open basic websites. What's more embarrassing is that the free service offered by Vancouver airport is much faster and doesn't cripple your access to web services. Other Star Alliance members should return the favour for Air Canada visitors to their lounges. In a world where bandwidth has become as cheap as water it is ridiculous that Air Canada can get away with fleecing other Star Alliance customers.,lounge
75,Lounge in Beijing which we used twice (London to Sydney return) was fine but did not have enough toilets and showers.,lounge
76,Arriving in Toronto at about 1.00pm we had a very long layover since the departure to CPH was at 21.05. The lounge was ok but the food choices and quality were very disappointing. Sort of dry boring sandwiches and three different warm dishes - all tasteless. If we should have waiting time at Toronto airport another day we rather pay for food in one of the eating places in the terminal than eating in the lounge. For a business class lounge of a 4 star airline the food is not adequate and compared to Scandinavian Airlines lounge in Copenhagen and Chicago it's poor. Even the TAP lounge at Lisbon airport has better food quality.,lounge
77,Nice lounge quiet and good internet  but needs to have dirty dishes picked up more often. Also their food offerings are poor. empty wine bottles and no staff to ask for assistance. Chips and hummus you need to scrape the bowl for. They need more staff and replace items more often. I still recommend it but if you need food go get it somewhere else first.,lounge
78,We used this on our inbound flight from New York and clearly we arrived at peak time. Not a seat to be found and the lounge was generally dirty and poorly managed. Staff on front-desk were more like guards than customer service staff. They scowled did not look up to greet us and were a very poor impression of Chinese service - in fact they were just rude. Food (as commented here already) was like a poor quality works canteen and mushy food that was not even hot. I looked at shower after a 50 minute wait and decided against using it. How does Star Alliance allow Air China to stay in with such low standard facilities? Never again on Air China.,lounge
79,At peak times the lounge gets very crowded and on hot sunny days you should avoid this lounge - it is stifling and the aircon never works properly. Staff on reception can be very friendly or very rude and inattentive - there does not seem to be an area in the middle. You can no longer get a fresh coffee and they removed the coffee machine that was installed for a few months and this is first class! The food is canteen type and rather greasy chinese food and probably best to wait for your flight to get a bite to eat. The toilets are kept clean by attendant that waits for you to tip him when you go in! The shower is tiny smells of drains and is best avoided. Furniture is tired and quite grubby and generally feel this lounge has continued to get worse and worse in the last 2 years. Avoid and go downstairs to Pizza Hut or Costa/Starbucks coffee for a nicer experience.,lounge
80,The lounge was physically fine but the snacks/food offerings were pathetic. A few applies and bananas sliced white bread for toast and pitchers of juice. I ended up with cereal and milk and thinking that there was great food for people flying coach right outside the doors. Also even with a sparsely populated lounge there was a line for the mens room because the mens room must apparently only cater to one person at a time.,lounge
81,I was surprised by the selection of quality food and alcoholic beverages. Being US-based I was able to compare the many differences between the US airline lounges with the quality of Air Canada. Maple Leaf Lounges are definitely the benchmark for other North American Airlines.,lounge
82,"I used the lounge on 22nd December 2012 at around 8AM. The staff at the welcome desk worked very hard to solve a very tricky problem. Their knowledge and level of care was absolutely great. They solved a problem which could have ruined our long planned holiday. I was very impressed and thankful. If there would be a possibility to rate the level of ""Standard of Staff Service"" better then Excellent - I would do so. The Transborder Maple Leaf Lounge at Terminal 1 Toronto Airport was exceptional due to the superior staff.",lounge
83,The lounge is spacious with leather seats in groups of two. There are some dining tables in the area of the food. The food was mixed Chinese with a choice of dumplings noodles and stir fries. Sandwiches and other packaged snacks are plentiful. Beer and wine is available but wine selection is limited. There are several sleeping pods available together with small shower facility.,lounge
84,"My wife and I visited the Air China First Class Lounge at PEK on October 8. We were flying United Global First to Washington DC IAD. We had 3 hours to departure at 6:20PM. When we entered the Lounge we found it to be very warm actually hot. It is a very large lounge and there were very few people there at the time. There were about 6 people working the front desk but I never saw any Air China Agents working in the lounge. The seting was leather chairs fairly comfortable with a small table between seating for 2. There was hot food available but it didn't appeal to Western tast mostly rice and soup We passed on the food. Some snacks the kind you scoop out of a jar with a spoon. The guy who was there before us had his hand in all the jars without the spoon so we passed on them also. Next we tried the bar. Self service with very little selection. I only saw Chinese beer in the cooler about 10 bottles of the usual liquor and mixers in the cooler. There was ice but it is not a good idea to use ice unless you know it was purified. No way to know that no one to ask. There were two bottles of Chinese ""Great Wall"" brand. One was dry red and the other was a cab. We tried the cab then switched to club soda. Star Alliance airlines should inspect this lounge and demand that Air China make necessary changes to bring it up to international standards. If you are going to use the Air China Beijing Lounge don't expect too much.",lounge
85,This is a great place to be 2 hours before your flight very quiet not around a lot of people. Many drink choices band a lot of food choices very comfortable and relaxing.,lounge
86,The lounge near the rock wall was the one I enjoyed the most. Wonderful selection of drinks food selection decent but only light foods. WiFi was excellent.,lounge
87,Quiet peaceful and comfortable place to sit. Have never experienced it to be too busy. The decor is new and it is always kept clean. Food area has lots of space and selection is the best I have experienced of any North American airport. Despite all of the shortcomings of this airport the Maple Leaf Lounges here are by far the best experience.,lounge
88,Quite spacious and busy lounge with nearly all facilities a passenger can demand. Luggage storage computer stations comfortable resting area hot food beverages separate sleeping/shower/TV rooms and digital flight information board. Since it is located on 4F you can also have a good view of the T3 terminal. There is another new Air China domestic lounge located in 2F no hot food is on offer but the lounge is much quieter.,lounge
89,"I waited one hour at the JAL lounge between gates 37 and 38. The lounge was comfortable enough with WiFi internet connections bathrooms and comfortable chairs. What I found very disappointing was the food. Apart from a few croissants a few cookies and a cauldron of clam chowder there was no food. There were two ""no Halal"" signs that I found rather funny. One was funny because it was set up amongst the few croissants and cookies - nothing was halal because there was almost nothing there I thought. The other was set up amongst all the bottles of spirits at the wet bar. Gee couldn't they find any halal alcohol? At this lounge JAL comes off looking cheap.",lounge
90,Was there on a stop-over from Singapore to Beijing. Very nicely decorated lounge. Comfortable seats. TV screen with Chinese channel. Separate smoking room. Not a quiet lounge all announcements with flight information given on the speakers (since this a busy airport there are continuous and very loud announcements). Very poor food choice (one soup 2 oriental dishes and some breads and instant noodles) for food. No wine only drinks in cans (including some beers) coffee tea. Staff with no smiles at all tables only cleaned after persons leave (I was there for 4 hours). No real complaints apart from the noise.,lounge
91,Dirty no food selection crowded with no place to sit. Unappealing decor. Stayed 15 minutes and then left to sit in the public area.,lounge
92,Nice looking large lounge with comfortable seating. Nice greeting on entering. Very good selection of drinks but food options limited and poor. Carrot and celery sticks and mountains of crackers. Only hot option was an unappealing soup and this was at dinner time.,lounge
93,We went to this lounge first thing in the morning because we had an early flight. The are supposed to open at 5:00 am and the door was still locked and the lights off when we arrived. We were let in about 10 minutes after and the girl was just putting things out. There really wasn't a big selection of food. There was tea coffee juice and she put out bread for toast terribly sweet muffins (in packages) and flavoured bagels none plain. There was also cereal. That was about it. I would not want to go there again. The lounge seemed old and in need of an update.,lounge
94,Very nice and quiet when we were there. Big issue is that warm food is only served from 06.30 till 09.00 and 11.00 till 19.30. Too bad if your flight is at 23.30. Some snacks available and limited beverages (3 choices of tea) coffee coke fanta beer juices one choice of red wine/white wine. If you want something hot there are instant noodles. Free wireless okay and fast. No TV screens no announcements of flights. Good staff service though.,lounge
95,Its okay but does not come close to First class lounges of other Asian airlines (eg Cathay Thai ANA etc). The staff here were miserable - no smiles no chat ... no nothing really except to check the boarding pass / invitation as if it was a top secret document. Hot food was available at one end of the lounge but this is geared totally to Chinese style and little else on offer. The washrooms have TV on the wall and annoying cleaning staff that stand around expecting you to give them a tip !? Certainly not a memorable lounge and had expected better from Air China since this is really quite new in 2007?,lounge
96,Nice Lounge but when you ask for Champagne nobody knows what is champagne! The white and red wine was around 2-3 weeks open and not drinkable. No food - only peanuts and other nuts. People are very polite but do not understand English. Internet WLAN works . Only small smoking room - no smoking lounge.,lounge
97,Way too crowded! The place was packed at 4:30 and stayed that way when we left at 6:00. Two planes including ours had slight delays. The food selection was nice especially the Thai soup. Because it was so busy the cleaning staff had a lot of work and empty dishes sat for 20-30 minutes. There didn't seem to be a place for us to drop off our used plates. Good selection of magazines and newspapers.,lounge
98,A very disappointing lounge which I have used several times for the past four years. Nothing much has changed in the period. Granted is a domestic terminal lounge but given the number of people who use it it is far too small. There are many international passengers who connect at YVR but there is not even a shower for people to freshen up after a 10+hr flight! There is no separate area for people who want to take a rest and because of the large number of people present it is very crowded and noisy-- not much different from the terminal building itself. Food is pretty average and always the same salad and soup options (but nothing vegetarian!).,lounge
99,Very spacious lounge with lots of comfortable seating and pleasant ambiance. Good selection of drinks snacks vegetables and dips. I've only used it in the evening when they also offer good pasta dishes and some salads. Staff is friendly. Only critique is that internet connection is often rather slow.,lounge
100,Very basic lounge with little by way of food selection - mostly packaged foodstuffs - and very limited beverages. Even the Chinese Tea is of poor quality. Reading materials even in Chinese language are very limited and no internet access. However it does have a toilet with a heated seat! Because the airport has an open departure gate system probably few advantages spending time in this lounge.,lounge
101,In general this is a very dreary lounge. Very crowded on all of my visits making it difficult to find a seat. Rather dark with no natural light. Snack and beverage is all right but don’t expect anything filling. Access to an internet connection is nearly impossible with people waiting turns. Smoking section is enclosed but very small and the smoke comes back into the large room. Not pleasant for either the smokers (no room) or the non-smokers. In general I have found sitting at the gate to be happier experience.,lounge
102,This lounge is big and well designed. Business centre with printing. Great selection of food snacks and drinks. Comfortable leather chair with foot rest in a mood room makes you a little too relaxed! I wish they had dedicated wifi for the lounge rather than using the general airport wifi which is fine but slow. Boarding announcements in a non intrusive way. For me this is the best AC lounge.,lounge
103,Excellent Lounge for North American standards. Drink selection very good food is usually rather light (salads and soups) but good. The weak point is the breakfast which is just cereals muffins and toast without any cheese ham or similar. They have an espresso / cappuccino machine producing excellent coffee. Free internet connection fast for Air Canada Elites usually works well unless the lounge is packed which can happen during peak hours.,lounge
104,Lounge had comfortable lounge chairs. Food was also adequate with hot and cold dishes. sandwiches and rolls in the fridge along with Beer and soft drink. Spirits also available. Not a large room however a good place to get away from the masses unless you needed a smoke.,lounge
105,Air China's international business class lounge is rudimentary at best. There are separate lounges for first & business class passengers. There is complimentary internet access but this tended to be very slow. Open bar & light snacks are available. The room does not seem to be staffed adequately to handle the large number of passengers using the facilities as garbage & dirty dishes lingered for considerable amounts of time. Seating is very primitive arranged in rows of seats like a regular waiting room.,lounge
106,Very old school menu hasn't been updated in God knows how long. The dishwasher broke so plastic utensils styrofoam cups and plates were used instead. Despite there being 2 other lounges in the airport to bring equipment from. Air Canada service continues to crumble.,lounge
107,When YVR was a single terminal airport the Maple Leaf Lounges were larger; now there are three (domestic US/transborder international) and I was in the transborder lounge on this trip. Access up one floor in an elevator. Amenities are self serve but more generous and much tidier than Continental or United Airlines lounges. Comfortable seats and workstations. Limited snack buffet is well-attended to. Staff keeping things in order. Wifi the new system where some lounge users get (ostensibly) faster wifi access is silly. It was better when you could just boot up your machine tick the box and get on with things. Overall YYZ lounge is bigger. YYC is grottier. YHZ is tiny. YOW' is probably the nicest (but busiest). On balance I'll take ANY of the YVR lounges thanks.,lounge
108,I have used this lounge many times and love it. Spacious and modern with nice touches like original glass sculpture in the bathrooms and light but good food choices and self serve bar. A world apart from any US airline lounge I have been to where food means pre-packaged tasteless cookies and a pay bar.,lounge
109,"This was a Priority pass lounge - not Air France! Comfortable enough but the food offerings here are as basic as you can get. A couple of ordinary sandwiches, some fruit and one type of a small maderia cake. The staff weren't in any rush to replenish either. Lazy lounge. Food and service.",lounge
110,This lounge is a complete joke - cramped poor food selection beyond carrot sticks tomatoes soup and stale looking bread. Some breakfast snack items are ok. Can mix your own drink - oh joy. Coffee and cappuccino is fair. Looks dated and worn. Staff moderately helpful. Embarrassing (my home airport) when compared to other airports around the world.,lounge
111,A disgrace there is no plausible reason to use this facility. The coffee is terrible food non-existent no showers apparently domestic has this for some reason and average business facilities. Staff at reception are friendly enough but that appears to be the limit of the hospitality. Wifi is now pointless as you can easily source it from many different services within the airport.,lounge
112,Spacious and quiet lounge with a wide range of quality food and alcohol including champagne. Enjoyable experience. Friendly staff.,lounge
113,Nobody at CDG airport seems to know where the AF arrival lounge is - they made my walk around for nearly one hour with plenty of luggage and I was unable to find. No signs anywhere.,lounge
114,One of the best lounges I have experienced. There are enough showers rooms. This is valuable as I usually come in this lounge before (or after) a 12-hour flight. I would have rated it 5* but the buffet especially drinks is a little bit skimpy.,lounge
115,All Maple Leaf Lounges at Trudeau are appalling. Domestic is old and cold and needs a refit and the other lounges are a mess newspapers and used plates and wineglasses just left. I broke my rule and connected through Montreal yesterday. Considering the new Terminal One at Pearson is such a nice experience Montreal Trudeau is a disgrace.,lounge
116,The lounge is within the acceptable range variety of food were served but some of them were poor in taste. The shower facility was very limited only 2 showers were provided and passenger need to ask the lounge staff to unlock the shower door. WI-FI and high-speed internet connection were provided computers and business facility were also available. Chairs were comfortable and few of them were recliners. Overall speaking the lounge is still fair but not the best one I've been to.,lounge
117,"The Maple Leaf lounge has been a very good ""office away from the office"" facility including free wifi a bowl of hot soup and the like. In a recent fit of penny-pinching Air Canada has started demanding that users purchase internet access using a credit card. It is not a huge sum - $10.00 - just enough annoy you especially when you know that you will have a fight with the accountants to claim it back. I sure hope that the pennies they accumulate from this change offset the costs associated with customer dissatisfaction.",lounge
118,It's worth noting that it very much depends on the terminal; typically if you are in 2E and 2F it's good level of lounge with showers fresh food coffee/ tea internet and power - all a business traveller wants. If you go to a lesser terminal 2D for example there really is nothing more than a seat coffee and power. It's worth noting that if you do have a long haul flight and you arrive before 2pm you can use the lounge in the arrivals area of 2C.. this has around 6 showers and the usual... not the most comfortable but the staff are polite and it's a hell of allot better waiting for your TGV (Train) in here after a shower.,lounge
119,This is a sorry excuse for a lounge. Drinks are plentiful but there was 1 sandwich when I walked in and an hour later still 1 sandwich. There were no plugs to recharge electronics and when I asked they directed me to unplug a lamp and use the socket! This is Air France's home country and this lounge is the best they've got? Quite sad as it is no better than a waiting room.,lounge
120,This place hasn't changed for years. Shower rooms are large and clean but had a really bad smell - like the sewer had backed up. The staff are welcoming but if I hadn't arrived so early and knew that my hotel room would not be ready I think I would just go straight to the hotel. Food offerings really limited in a small crowded room.,lounge
121,One of the nicest lounges I've seen with great breakfast offerings and superb staff. And then there's the views!,lounge
122,I'm surprised at people complaining about food in Maple Leaf lounge. Air Canada provides comfort food (soup cookies bagels) free drinks internet access a great selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge in Vancouver has a stunning view of the North Shore mountains - lounge in Edmonton has a fireplace - lounge in Ottawa is glass on 3 sides. Admittedly the domestic lounge in Toronto is often crowded with slow check-in. The international lounge there is soaring.,lounge
123,We flew Aeromexico Business class from JFK to Mexico City On March 2014. Since the Aeromexico and Air France have a SkyTeam alliance agreement we went to Air France’s Business Lounge in Terminal 1 at JFK. The lounge is small and clean and does offer relaxation time before boarding. One can sit in a deep cushion chair place food on the table or use the complimentary computers. Food offerings on March 19 2014 started with stale roast beef/cheese sandwiches that came from the deep freeze cheap corn chips and packaged cookies one can find in a Supermarket etc. Champagne and other alcoholic and soft drinks were available in ample quantity. The coffee was good and so strong.,lounge
124,Noticed a small improvement in the food served here in this lounge I visit regularly. If you use this lounge after 7pm you might enjoy a light meal . Choices 10 days ago were a nice beef roulade salad and or grilled vegetables. Soup is also available usual cheese and cake for desert. Much better food then before in this lounge and more fun eating here then food served in airplanes at 1 am. Alcohol wines etc are excellent …If only Air France would see to it there would be some decent food all day long instead of having chocolate chip cookies from 1pm to 7pm this would be a further much appreciated improvement.,lounge
125,Absolutely appalling. Dreadful food and tables covered with dirty plates and glasses that the non- existent staff have failed to remove. Quite the worst lounge I have ever been in.,lounge
126,Rather disappointed with the lack of breakfast choices when I used this lounge for an early morning flight. Bread butter muffin and a small bowl of fruit which emptied very quickly and took the attendants ages to top up. Coffee and tea only beverage choices with just 1 jug of orange on display. The Maple Leaf lounge had a rather' stingy' feel overall would not use it again.,lounge
127,Very pleasant lounge close to our departure gate. Food somewhat limited but my daughter enthused about the soup (only hot dish on offer). Seating comfortable and ranged from lounge chairs to dining with a good few recliners as well. Business services were excellent with swift internet access. Sadly only two showers for the whole of this busy lounge and you have to ask the reception staff to unlock them and then wait while they find a cleaner to re-stock and clear up after the last occupant!,lounge
128,This is one of the poorest lounges I have visited. The seats are worn food on offer consisted of a bowl of soup (in fairness very nice) and some cheese and very tired looking salad. There are no showers in this lounge which really surprised me. Not much of an advert for Air Canada at all. Staff were enthusiastic and pleasant.,lounge
129,Had a five hour stopover between flights. No problems using this lounge for that length of time. Very spacious lounge with plenty of seating and tables for dining. Food provided was of the snack/light meal variety but was good quality. Champagne and wine available on a help your self basis. Toilet and shower facilities were excellent with really good shower lots of hot water at high pressure and good amenity pack provided. All in all an excellent oasis of calm in a very busy airport.,lounge
130,2 very small elevators as stairs to get to this lounge which is not that easy to find but i know my way around cog terminal 2e gate L OR K. Lounge is small surely for the crowd that makes usage of this lounge. Lounge is dark and not clean . it was early morning so food choice was poor choice as usual in cog airport  croissant  pain au chocolate cereals and something a new a chocolate that has no chocolate taste. Coffee and espresso machine seems to be in need of repair as what i received from this coffee maker had no coffee taste . For those wanting boost early in the morning everything available as soft drinks . As usual af lounge leaves me wondering why do I bother.,lounge
131,Dreadful. Avoid this lounge if you can. Looks like a temporary facility. Food was dreadful staff were invisible as were the facilities.,lounge
132,Buried in the basement of CDG this lounge gets extremely crowded at times. Two flights a day to Canada and if one is delayed then it is sitting room on the floor only. Food not bad croissants cheeses yogurts etc. for breakfast and some sandwiches later on in the day plus the usual array of drinks. The lone staff person was excellent although it is ridiculous that those of us with connections that we are going to miss because of delays cannot be rebooked onto another flight. We have to wait till we get to Canada to be rebooked making everyone very cranky.,lounge
133,Limited view of the apron. Newspaper/food/drink selections minimal. Good business facilities. Toilet facility inadequate and was not kept clean.,lounge
134,This small lounge is also used by Air France at times and quickly becomes overcrowded. The rest of Terminal 2 at LAX is even more congested. Public washrooms are located outside the lounge but are well-maintained. Good selection of self-serve beverages but food is limited to cheese and crackers. Large west-facing windows provide nice views but only two have pull-down shades. As a result the lounge becomes too hot. Tattered furniture needs replacing.,lounge
135,La Premiere Lounge at CDG is probably the best airport lounge I have experienced. Limo transfer direct from disembarkation gate on arrival from long haul flight. Air France staff accompanies to the dedicated security lane inbound to lounge. In the lounge enjoy the Alain Ducasse restaurant some exceptional wine. Beautifully restful chaise longue area with subdued lighting for resting. Toilets and showers are a work of art. Nice bathrobes and slippers with top of the range cosmetics/shower products. Agent drives you to the steps of your departing plane for the next sector.,lounge
136,Crowded and hard to find a place to sit. Washrooms dirty and small for size of lounge. Food service non existent but decent choice of soft drinks available. Overall not impressive and rather poor offering from a reputable air carrier.,lounge
137,Very nice small lounge at Heathrow. Good continental breakfast available excellent showers and 2 computers. What makes this lounge special is the excellent staff friendly and helpful. Every time I use this lounge is it very empty could be because it is located outside the terminal a short walk from the arrivals area.,lounge
138,The Toronto Pearson lounge was not very good food wise. I guess they assume everyone would prefer to drink then eat. If you like alcohol then this is the place for you if you don't then take snacks with you.,lounge
139,This lounge was recently opened and is quite nice and very bright inside. It has almost 360 Degree windows which allow light in. As with most Maple Leaf lounges the food is almost non existent. I was there between 8-10AM and there was only some bread for toasting and some yogurt and granola. The business center was good with several computers connected to the internet and several places to dock personal computers. Overall I would say this lounge is much better than the old one.,lounge
140,Very poor facilities old lounge what are they doing? Very poor services friendliness cleanliness etc.,lounge
141,I took the opportunity to test the new AF lounge at the newest boarding satellite called S4. A completely new experience from the other lounges I have visited at CDG. Very large seperated in several areas with a real bar with the usual selection and great wines and a first for any AF lounge a self service Hot food corner including some risotto pasta cold meat and some pastries for dessert. A huge step from the S3 lounge. No problem at all to find a table or a sofa to rest. Plenty of working space and reading material too. Modern design with a nice view on the tarmac. Hope they would upgrade the other lounges the same way!,lounge
142,Kind of a fail. This lounge is dated worn and desperately needs air conditioning. The leather chairs are worn and dirty. The wi-fi is slower than the general free Frankfurt Airport wi-fi and just outside the lounge is a long hallway with recliners for regular passengers to lounge in comfort. The only places to sit in the lounge for lounge customers are upright chairs. Additionally there are no bathrooms within the lounge and if you need those facilities you are directed to leave the lounge and go down the hall to use public bathrooms. Given all of this I'm not really sure why you would choose to come in to this lounge unless you would like to eat some of the simple packaged cookies or the cheese that is sitting out in warm temperatures. Very little in the way of hard liquor. No red wine on display and a single white wine in the refrigerator. There was a sparkling wine in an ice bucket that was untouched. I found this whole wine selection to be odd. Air France needs to spend a little effort at improving this lounge in my opinion.,lounge
143,Very good lounge as there was a variety of canapés and drinks. Lounge staff were happy to help with any of your needs.,lounge
144,Lounge is easy to find and close to gate but lounge is still the same lounge as I have visited to many times when flying from this airport. Not so comfortable chairs that are already showing there usage. Cheap South African wine and some sandwiches chips crackers and some cheese. Not really a place to enjoy relax after working all day and still having to fly 10 hours. Wifi improved and is working very well now.,lounge
145,A few seats uncomfortable. No decent food coffee and tea from coin machines. Some newspapers. Such a minimal lounge that I now avoid it and use the open bars and cafes of the airport far better and friendlier.,lounge
146,Old and crowded lounge always full. They have 3 flights (2 AF and one KLM) departing early evening so the space is not enough for all passengers. The food is mediocre and there is only one old shower in urgent need of renovation.,lounge
147,My daughter and I took the AI116 from LHR to Delhi. I have never seen a worse spread of snacks in any lounge before. We had to go downstairs to a cafe to get a bite. Food was stale and cold.,lounge
148,This is the only lounge I have seen which is before the security so if you are at highest member level or are flying business class you need to reach little early if you wish to use the lounge. The purpose of relaxing at lounge and boarding when boarding starts will not stand true in this case. Odd and strange it is but this is Air India you can expect anything. The reason I can think of is if you visit their lounge you would notice that it is generally occupied by Airline staff itself and after a minute or two someone will be visiting from Airline to have a snack so it is a free restaurant for them. Last month I sent them a mail that their lounge plugs are not working from months.,lounge
149,I arrived in the early morning from Toronto to Heathrow on Air Canada and was transferring to Air India flight to Delhi. The lounge does not open until 3 hours prior to the flight which meant I could not use the lounge for several hours. Most airlines use partner lounges when their lounge is not open. The lounge itself isn't too bad but is small and has little services.,lounge
150,We used the business class lounge of Charles de Gaulle as transit passengers. The experience was horrible. Dirty seats empty bags and paper glasses no choice in food just some packaged stuff. Plus the lounge was crowded. On the way back the lounge was almost empty but the manager decided to prevent us from getting in with 10 and 12 yrs old children (who were on economy class tickets). All in all my experience with Air France is way below average.,lounge
151,The lounge is okay and I get to do my work without interruptions or noise. However in the morning and there is no food - just snacks I thought by now with all the complaints something would be different. People care about food they want to eat Air France please listen to your customers!!,lounge
152,A charming stewardess picks you up at the incoming flight taking you to this dedicated Lounge. A butler welcoming you a Michelin starred restaurant with perfect service and outstanding wines. The quality of showers massage is like a hotel. All passport formalities completed in the lounge.,lounge
153,No Soft drinks! No towels to shower with! Toilets are dirty. By far the worst Star Alliance lounge we have been to.,lounge
154,What a depressing place! This lounge is definitely not to be recommended for a long transit. Having recently been condemned to staying in the lounge for 12 hours I cannot recommend this lounge. The food was practically non existent. Just one badly bruised banana and a single rotting orange and a few snacks. There was butter and jam but no bread until morning. When I asked for the use of the shower I was made to feel it was putting the staff out. Staff were few and far between and totally disinterested in customer service. The decor is outdated and dirty. Wifi is available but so complicated to connect it is worthless. There is little to redeem this lounge.,lounge
155,The lounge is clean. Seating adequate. There is a meagre but reasonable selection of snacks and drinks. WiFi available. Staffing limited and they seem disinterested.,lounge
156,One of the worst I have been in. It is very small and has the most uncomfortable chairs. Before international flights in the evening it is packed. People walking around trying to find a seat. The bathrooms are small and dirty. Food selection is minimal. Plenty of cold drinks. Do not pay extra to get into this lounge.,lounge
157,"Absolutely diabolical. The food selection is virtually non-existent unless you like potato As a regular JNB passenger I visit this lunge often. The worst part are the most uncomfortable seats - the seat are designed to make a ""statement"" but are the most uncomfortable ever experienced among many business lounges around the world. Air France should look at their KLM partner lounges in AMS and its seat / electric outlet convenience (still no international plugs - they require adapters). Food and beverage selection is decent and so is the internet functionality. Men's bathroom typically dirty sometime lacking supplies.",lounge
158,Absolutely diabolical. The food selection is virtually non-existent unless you like potato crisps/chips. What food there is (cold slabs of processed pork a bowl of mini-gherkins and some awful sandwiches) is desperately low quality. There is no service within the lounge itself which is sterile and uncomfortable. In AF's home country at their home airport this is a disgrace.,lounge
159,If you want to feel depressed about your choice of airline Air India's Business Lounge in Delhi International will do it for you. Curry or Curry with rice for a meal. Samosas in an oven that had been there for at least a week. 2 beers in the fridge dirty plates stacked everywhere toilets that need a pressure cleaner desperately. Truly third world and nowhere near international standards. Flickering or dead light fixtures tired interior no staff no food if you are sick of curry just no point. Got so sick of the depressing place I went next door and paid to use another lounge.,lounge
160,Poor service. Imagine the frustration of getting off an overnight flight and finding the lounge closed at 8.30am (their website specifies an 8.00am opening time). With no indication of 'when' they would be open casual discussion with others in the area indicated a 10am opening!,lounge
161,Was shocked at the condition of the place. Staff were incredible wonderful. No complains abt them. The sofas were all stained. No way anyone could rest there. So small and people were talking so loudly children screaming. No wifi at all. Staff kept apologising to us - it was not their fault. We could not even entertain ourselves with our mobile or tabs (as wifi was totally out). Food was horrible. Coffee machine made alot of noise. No proper reading material. A lady was bringing the roof down saying she was economy but wanted to sit inside and rest. Finally we left this dirty lounge and went to the main seating area near the gates. Tried to buy some food to eat hardly could eat because pigeons were over our heads and that was so unhealthy. We left out food and drinks (which we bought) and went to wait at the gate. We just cannot believe that an International airport is in such a state. The finale is the toilet next to the Lounge - it was like a public toilet. I have to indicate a star at least below otherwise I cannot proceed to submit this. I dont wish to give a star at all for anything below except 5 stars for the poor staff to deal with all this.,lounge
162,Pretty awful. Food is very poor and coffee is truly dreadful. Decor is ugly fittings are falling off the walls staff are invisible (debris stays at tables for hours).,lounge
163,It seems that most lounges from Air France I visit suffer from the same acute problem. Food quality and choice is ridiculous compared with lounges from other airlines. AF lounge in Paris terminal 2E food choice is very poor and cheap quality. Most food there is cheap sandwiches crackers and chips. Choice of drinks is ok even if wine quality could be better to even much better.,lounge
164,The lounge in 2F at CDG is a shame as the terminal 2F itself. In the entrance the welcome speech from the staff is almost an apology about the lounge situation. One floor was closed so the remaining space was totally crowded. The only seats we could find were at a table in the end facing bathrooms. Very limited food choice only cold croissants and nuts crisps. There were only one shower 40 minutes wait time.,lounge
165,I have been using Delhi international airport biz/first class lounge for last two years on way to US and Asia. Pathetic food and same menu. Internet is always down when asked why it is down for 2 years no answer. Selection of alcohol is very sad papers/magazines variety is limited. Too many people working but not working think there are three managers for every person working. Overall disappointing.,lounge
166,Executive Lounge for Air India in Changi Airport Terminal 2 was very comfortable. Wonderful variety of food coffee tea etc. Fruits Sandwiches. 4 exercise lounge chairs. Good wifi connection. Polite staff and helpers inside the lounge. Though we had to wait for 2 over hours we enjoy the comfort in this lounge. I even had a good 1 over hour of sleep to make up for getting up early to come to the airport. Lovely clean toilets.,lounge
167,Air India Terminal 3 international Lounge is very spacious clean and well kept facility. The staff were courteous and helpful. The sofa and slumber lazboys were comfortable for napping and taking a break. Food was fresh tasty but selection was a little limited. The drinks and beverage selection was good and the staff brought it to my sitting area (maybe local regulations about an open bar). The internet connectivity with Tatadocomo was challenging - one of the lounge staff members had to help me connect. The toilet and showers were clean. I can see the lounge getting very busy and crowded in the future. But for me it was a good experience and a pleasant surprise.,lounge
168,The design is very trendy and it offers nice views on the apron. It is divided in several zones depending on what you are looking for. Usually AF lounges are not very good for the catering but this one offers a wide choice of food and drinks. I took advantage of the Clarins Spa that is free. It's now time for Air France to offer a consistent product and offer the same comfort and quality and choice of food in all their lounges.,lounge
169,I don't understand the Air France business class product at all particularly compared to similarly priced business class products like British Airways or Virgin Atlantic (which actually are less expensive). At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal. At Air France I got to chose from slices of cold pork some cheese some crackers and potato chips. I do my best to avoid Air France but sometimes I have no other option.,lounge
170,Flew with Icelandair who use this new Air France lounge. Staff in lounge very friendly food was sandwiches and nuts. Food well presented bar staffed at all times this I thought was not good as I like to get my own drinks. Showers great and very refreshing water hot and shower room was well cleaned. If I had one complaint I would say the seating looks like old school chairs. Great views from the big windows of the aircraft coming and going. I also imagine that with a A380 the lounge would be cramped and very busy - Lucky only 2 B777's on my departure day.,lounge
171,I was traveling first class to US from Delhi and had 3 h to spend in the Air India lounge. I was shocked to see that this is the flagship lounge of Air India in India's capital. What a shame. First the first and Executive lounges are not separate. They are separated by a barricade nthat was easily crossed. There is no wait staff even for first class passengers. When one flies Emirates or Lufthansa in first class the respective lounges provide an opportunity for a high quality sit down meal from an a la carte menu. In the AI lounge food left a lot to be desired. The bathroom was in shambles and there was no lotion. Magazine choice was non existent. Wifi was spotty and complicated. why can't they provide free wifi without the need for passwords cell phones etc ? Very absurd. And the bar service was pitiful and most of the time non existent. Again no waiters even in first class section. In summary the premium lounge in the airport shared by many airlines is similar but at least predictable in service (albeit poor). The AI lounge is awful and takes away from first class experience. The managers don't care and are never around to receive feedback leave alone make changes. Best avoided for same reason AI is best avoided. First class pax are not escorted to the plane either.,lounge
172,"Had a 4 hour layover in Delhi while returning from Frankfurt and going to Hyderabad. The lounge was easy to find and the ambience was quite decent with enough seating. However every aspect of service is poor. I asked for a toothbrush in the morning; after bring ignored by the lounge manager and then again by the uniformed lady I got it through the attendant but the kit seems to have been ""borrowed"" from Hotel Centaur (whose name was written on the pack). The breakfast was pathetic - very little options and the one I had Poha was cold dry and just a step above eating sand. The ketchup that was served looked like it was diluted 10 times over. The coffee and tea served were tasteless cold and unappetizing. I had to go out and eat breakfast in a restaurant outside. There is no WiFi in the lounge and they give you some sort of cards that have a validity of 45 minutes. On the day I visited even that was not available. Since I was coming from an international leg I thought of taking a shower before taking the domestic leg. When I asked the lounge manager for a towel I was flatly told that they had ""run out of towels"" - when I asked how long it will be before they can get fresh ones I was told that it will come the next day only! Since the lounge was quite empty I asked the manager how many towels he keeps a day and he said that they have a limit of 6 towels a day. I asked how they expected other guests to shower and he gave me a look that conveyed that I had exhausted my limit on the questions I can ask him. The lounge manager was very quick to refuse every request for service. He also has a bright future in the Indian Administrative system because he never forgets to treat you with disdain and demonstrate to you that he is under no obligation to provide you any service whatsoever. I am have flown Air India internationally for almost 18 years and they have managed to completely escape the service revolution that has happened everywhere in the world. The quality of service is as poor as it was 18 years back and though the faces of service staff is younger they have managed to encapsulate the same sense of apathy and disdain for passengers that existed earlier.",lounge
173,A large but outdated lounge. Furniture adequate but showing signs of wear and tear. The lighting poor with many light bulbs flashing on and off. Food is basic with little choice. Toilet areas kept clean but no facilities for a wash after a long flight. There are showers but these were closed and out of use. I asked for a shaving kit. Told they are available but none left 'sorry'. Only computer access is via three outdated computers. Staff kept the lounge clean and tidy. This is not however up to modern standards. This is not a place to enjoy a long transit.,lounge
174,Clean and roomy lounge not much selection for food around and usual drinks selections. Nothing special for the time I was there.,lounge
175,Dirty tables uncleared for hours - looks like 3rd class train waiting room. Go to a restaurant instead.,lounge
176,Lounge quiet and peaceful. Not a wide range of food but adequate and plentiful. Wifi available.,lounge
177,Air India use the Louis Tavern lounge in Bangkok airport which is open to the general public on payment. There are very limited facilities in the lounge (no TV no toilets) but a better drinks and food selection than either the Air India lounges used on this trip or the Thai lounges used in Bangkok before. Wifi good and accessed via passkeys provided at reception to lounge. Aircraft boarding information needs improvement though. Not busy despite the amount of people in the airport that morning.,lounge
178,The lounge was airy with good food. Plenty of quality wines. The wi-fi connection was efficient. Toilets were clean. The lounge is close to the boarding gate. This made for a pleasurable experience.,lounge
179,This lounge is small but quiet most of the time. The front desk assistant was friendly and made sure to make announcements about flights which were boarding. The snacks are fresh and delicious. The bar selection was not extensive but there is a reason for this - If you want a drink such as champagne or a caipirinha just ask! The restrooms were small but clean. There was constant removal of empty plates glasses etc. The internet was very slow during the peak hours but at other times the internet speed was fair.,lounge
180,Lounge is used by many airlines too many for the size of the lounge even if I got lucky this time and found a good seat. The lounge is used by so many airlines that announcements for flight boarding are going on forever - maybe they should learn from other lounges and make this one a silent one. Food quality is poor and choice is at the same disappointing level. Drinks consist of cans and bottles that are presented in a very small refrigerator - meaning the cans have no time to become col. Wine served is local brew. Lets hope for a Skyteam lounge in new terminal. Wifi is very badly organised and only 3 computers available.,lounge
181,Air Mauritius have the use of the Air France lounge in Johannesburg. The lounge was small and very quiet. The seating was of modern design to the point of being weird looking (imagine 30+ IKEA designs) and too close together. Other than reception staff (2 ladies who were clearly uninterested in customer service) I did not see a single attendant/waiter. The food was boring limited cold and stale. The coffee (from an automated machine) was quiet OK though. Of the 5 available PC's for client use only 3 were working. Those 3 had such a slow response time for internet surfing that I didn't achieve anything anyway. The screen savers timed out the sessions as well.,lounge
182,The Air Mauritius lounge at Port Louis is as expected for the national airline's home lounge large well-equipped and has a warm welcoming feel. The food is excellent quality and plentiful with staff more than happy to assist.,lounge
183,Visited whilst in international transit. Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi 7 up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory (2 veg 1 meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!). Wifi is the airports and not the lounges - limited and very slow - had to use the dedicated terminals instead. Was again a good place to rest and read but not on a par with other carriers i have flown.,lounge
184,Myself and fellow passengers entered this lounge 3 hours before the flight to be told the hot food would not be available for another 30 minutes. Good points - plenty of seating good wi-fi newspaper selection tv drinks selection notified when it was time to board. Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out. The staff were overstretched (there appeared to be only 2 of them) and as a result items were not cleared or refreshed. Recommend the lounge as an escape from the crowds but eat beforehand.,lounge
185,This is not so much of a lounge as somewhere to sit while you wait for a flight. The bar or the lack of one was very disappointing as it was closed. How long it has been that way or if it would open again is anyone's guess. The cold drinks were dreadful food was hot but not a great selection. Okay if you only want Indian food but would be nice to have had a selection after all it was the international lounge with international passengers. The lounge at Heathrow T4 was better bright clean but a very limited selection of Indian food some biscuits and a few alcoholic drinks on show. Air India lounges are best forgotten.,lounge
186,Same old overcrowded lounge with same food and drinks (choice not very big or interesting) espresso machines are dirty and food is tasteless. Lounge is also used by people having a certain credit card. While waiting to get in and present your invitation one has to wait for the man in front of you deciding if he is going to charge his credit card with money or points.,lounge
187,Too small both the AF and KLM flights leave within a few minutes it is far too crowded. No power outlets seating not very comfortable lounge looks a bit worn. Drink selection just ok food not what you would expect of the French!,lounge
188,This is without doubt the worst lounge as far as food is concerned. A 11pm flight and nothing to eat but crisps and dry cheese. Air France should be ashamed.,lounge
189,Not a lot has changed since the review on here from 2007 by the look of it. Used by Air France Emirates and Air Mauritius. Still 2 levels limited choice of food drink not bad. Handy for the departure gates only 20 metres away from Gate 1 for example. Plenty of flat screen large TVs dotted around the lounge but all switched off. Was quite crowded when we passed through with 3 flights departing at the end of the day. (It looks as if they are building another terminal next door to the current one so things will probably be improved all round when its finished.,lounge
190,Small but cosy - no windows. Limited quantity and variety of food drinks ok as far as tea and coffee are concerned. Some place to store luggage. The business lounge is sort of a mezzanine above the first class lounge shared by Air Mauritius and Air France. Very easy to find right after immigration and security check and pretty close to boarding gate. Clean restrooms and clean and comfortable shower rooms - unfortunately just 2 internet PCs that are always busy.,lounge
191,This must be the worst lounge in existence a dreadful room to spend any time in. We had to ask for the air conditioning to be switched on as it was so hot and stuffy. The lounge had a old microwave oven in one corner that they (when we finally were able to find a staff member) could offer an instant coffee or a cup or tea. It looked nasty so we plumped for a small (very small) bottle of water we were also offered a biscuit. After a nine hour Air India flight with not a great deal to eat we were hungry but I am afraid that the cupboard was bare. Just to add that if you (like us) had to transit from the international to domestic 1a leave plenty of time as you will pass through a least 2 xray checks and a least 6 more security checks plus a 5 kilometer bus ride (packed like sardines) up three floors to the so-called lounge and then down one or two floors to your departure gate. We have to repeat it in December as we have already booked the flights. What you get for a cheap fare.,lounge
192,This is the most miserable lounge I've ever been in. Furniture is falling to pieces no toilet paper in the ladies' toilet food terrible and staff as slow as a wet week. Awful coffee delivered after a long wait.,lounge
193,The new Maharaja lounge just past security is still not open. I went to the Maharaja lounge by gate 3 passed security on 14th April 2012. I would not recommend this lounge to anyone. I arrived in this Room full of mosquitoes old worn out furniture with people trying to sleep on the worn out shabby settees I do not know how they could sleep with all that noise and constant phone going off and people just entering the lounge asking questions about other air lines. They will only serve you water or juice as apparently they will not serve alcohol to business or first class passengers on International flights since 1st April so a dry room. When I arrived in this excuse of a lounge there were about 20 children screaming and running around without any supervision apparently they were being looked after by a member of staff so they were not booked as business or first class passengers she then moved them to a more suitable area after about 10 minutes. You have to ask for water or juice. I asked for tea and they do serve this. Snacks are from a microwave and again you have to ask but I would not recommend these over microwave snacks. I walked out and still cannot believe this so called first and business class lounge is still in use it should have been closed years ago.,lounge
194,A perfectly adequate lounge a bit small. Not as nice as the bigger 2E lounge but nice. Staff very friendly. Food fine - sandwiches yoghurt soup crisps and drinks. I enjoy the Air France lounges.,lounge
195,A good lounge with direct access to gate M7 usually the one used by the AF departure. Great supply of French newspapers adequate Wifi snacks/sandwiches usually OK Champagne very good (but has a tendency to run out quickly and staff less than enthusiastic about bringing new bottle).,lounge
196,Terrible Lounge - no water in the toilets neither for washing hands. I used the only 50CL bottle at around 19.00 hrs. Was sitting close to the toilet entrance and observed that none of the lounge staff put a new bottle of water - during 3 hours (time of boarding). In the meantime people were walking in/out and of course did their thing without washing hands!,lounge
197,After the chaos confusion and long wait through immigration and security this was a shocking surprise. At first we wondered if we were in the right place. Dingy and old fashioned with no sign of any refreshments at all. No wifi and a Desk top that had to be repaired before it was usable. The toilet facilities were the worst we have seen in a so called Business Class lounge. While we were there some Indian people were offered a drink and light refreshments (so presume there was catering of some sort somewhere) but not us or other Europeans. A miserable alternative to the much better options just outside the door.,lounge
198,I was shocked when entering the lounge because I wasn't sure if this was the correct place to be? Plenty of seats that look it's straight from the 60s-70s but very little people except a few sleeping. The staff is polite though have trouble understanding English. I wasn't sure if there was food/drink available but noticed the staff asking an India passenger so I inquired. No Wi-Fi but there is one older PC with internet. I needed to use a phone to call a local number for confirmation and that was difficult to do because they couldn't figure out if I could or if I had to use someone's cell though the staff was helpful enough to let me borrow one of their mobile phones. I left after a short time as there were a couple of older TVs that were fairly loud. Overall I'd avoid this lounge and stick to the airport which is much nicer.,lounge
199,Waiting for my flight from Mumbai to Singapore I was entitled to use the Maharaja Lounge since I was a business class passenger. There are two lounges that can be used one before security and one after. I chose to use the one after security because the lines were extremely long. The waiting area after security is very sparse but had an adequate number of seats. The lounge appeared decent from the outside. Once inside I felt I had entered into the 1970s. There were sofas and chairs that were upholstered with a flower pattern. The tables and everything else was wood (mahogany?). The two young men manning the information desk took my lounge pass. I found a seat among the many people who had already taken entire sofas to sleep on. Being a midnight flight there were many sleeping people. There were no drinks or food offered in the open. One of the young men offered water to other passengers and I had to ask for water. Later on the young man was taking the order of another passenger and finally asked me if I wanted coffee or tea. The only redeeming factor of this lounge was that the Masala Chai was decent. Other than that I felt like I had been transported back to the 1970s due to the furniture of the lounge. Also if other Indian passengers had not ordered coffee/tea I feel like I never would have been asked being the only non-Indian passenger in the lounge.,lounge
200,Malaysia Airlines use this lounge -small and shabby with uncomfortable seating. The choice of food and drinks was very poor. The staff were rather indifferent and off hand when we asked for more croissants. They were having a delivery of stock which was being wheeled through the lounge during the whole of the one and half hours we were there not a very relaxing atmosphere! There is no left luggage facility so if you want to shop you have to take you hand luggage with you. For a European Airport the standard of this lounge is shocking.,lounge
201,Lounge is really average and comparable to other AF lounges in CDG. The letdown is the poor quality of the food offered. It was lunch time we were provided with a meagre choice of soup sandwiches a slice of turkey and cheese. Needless to say every one rushed for food there was nothing left besides the usual chips and crackers. The lounge is big let down as 2E is the modern part of CDG.,lounge
202,Arriving at 1830 the upper level was very full and everywhere you looked there were trays with empty cans wrappers napkins etc. Catering not that bad. An assortment of grilled sandwiches soup crisps bread cheese nuts etc. Staff manning the desks were a bit sullen. I hope that their other lounges at CDG are of better quality.,lounge
203,The lounge in 2F at CDG is small and very crowded. The only seats we could find were at a table in the cafe area at the back. The whole place feels more like a railway station waiting room than a business class lounge. Limited food choice some sandwiches nuts crisps etc. Are all AF lounges at CDG as abysmal as this?,lounge
204,Air France business lounges in Terminal 2C and 2F are very similar. Upper Deck Closes at 1630 adding to overcrowding of the small main lounge which at peak times is horrible overcrowded loud and noisy. Selection of drinks is limited sometimes there are some snacks (cheese baguettes fruits etc) which disappear within a few minutes because of the big amount of guests. Rest rooms are too small and Staff do not seem to be very motivated or even attempt to pretend they care! The feedback unit did not work which says it all.,lounge
205,Le Patiolounge is located on the 1st floor of Orly-Ouest Hall 2 just after the security check. Staff is very polite and friendly. Lounge is clean and seats are comfortable with a nice view on the apron. There are three free internet computers - all were working properly. Quite a large selection of newspapers but most of them in French and only two in English. The huge disappointment is the poor food and drinks. For hot drinks there are only vending machines - the same type as in gas stations. The choice for cold beverages is a bit larger but only small cans are offered. Forget about food - at any time of the day the lounge offers only chips or biscuits!,lounge
206,"The staff are reasonably polite but that's where the positives end. We were both starving when we got to the lounge at 6pm but there was no hot food. I then decided to have some cold food but there was hardly any of that either! What is the use of crackers without cheese or butter? Only Air France knows the answer to that. All they had was crisps. On complaining to the staff I was told since ""a few months ago"" they only serve food at certain times. When they did eventually serve the much awaited fare it was tepid soup and that was about it.",lounge
207,Basic lounge upstairs of the main alley in the terminal. No view except over the shopping corridor below. Limited range of food except crisps biscuits. Even during lunch hours disappointing. Drink range adequate so is the reading material. Couple of pc with free internet access good but faulty connection. Toilets are outside the lounge.,lounge
208,Very modern looking retro lounge. It has several work stations and free wifi. Several staff had occupied one corner and were trying to hide while being noisy and consuming lounge food and beverages. Food included crisps fruit pies quiches sandwiches. There was a self service bar with wines beers soft drinks coffees sparkling wine and spirits. Good choice. Not too much reading material.,lounge
209,I spent all day in this lounge on my trip from Canada to Perth and back and got to experience it from early morning to early evening. The showers were clean and well stocked and the food was amazing. There was lots of it and a wide variety of delicious restaurant quality items. Offerings changed at breakfast morning tea lunch afternoon tea and dinner and all were tasty and carefully presented. An onsite barista and an assortment of beverages made a long long layover a little more bearable. The only thing lacking was somewhere to recline and get some sleep.,lounge
210,"Not a good experience Despite Pudong having a lot of lounges passengers from several flights seem to be packed into just 1 so that the staff end up trying to find seats for guests. The welcome was poor along the lines of ""voucher sit down"". Food poor no white wine only red and a request for white was met with a simply ""no"". In the end we moved out To the main concourse as it is quieter more pleasant and far less crowded. What is the point of paying extra for this?",lounge
211,"I wonder if we are talking about the same lounge here. There are two international terminals one for Saudi Arabian airlines and one for all other airlines. At the ""foreign"" international terminal the lounge was crowded and obviously too small but let's say it did the job: a seat free drinks free Wi-fi. Women can access the lounge and sit anywhere (it is not separate). There are large TV screens and staff announce flights on time.",lounge
212,I found the lounge to be excellent. The showers were clean and tidy seating comfortable. The snack food including gluten-free was excellent and main course was OK. Drinks excellent. The lounge was busy but not too crowded. Probably the only minus is the very loud and frequent airline announcements which make it difficult to speak on the phone.,lounge
213,Overall quite disappointing. The place is crowded dirty (trash on the floor seats are dirty dirty glasses and plates on many tables). The food selection is good if they have any (some offerings have been empty of 30 min now). No clean gasses for soda etc. Looks like they are trying to cut cost wherever possible. Wifi is incredibly slow.,lounge
214,The furniture is very worn but there are spaces to go to get away from the noise down one end. The toilets have a questionable aroma though and need an update with their chipped toilet seats. Food and drink selection is fairly basic but there is usually something to fill a snack gap before the flight. My favourite is the hotdog stand. Cleaning staff are diligent and clear dishes. It's better than sitting on a plastic chair at the gate.,lounge
215,The lounge is pretty basic. Small not particularly well kept. Chairs are worn and electric outlets were not adapted to American plugs. The highlight of the lounge is the older man who works there who showed me how to pour my sweet Vermouth properly (over ice). Lounge has a decent supply of newspapers.,lounge
216,Good selection of food and drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic however the seats are the most uncomfortable I have even seen. This is definitely not a lounge you would want to spend a lot of time waiting for a flight! Their old lounge was far more comfortable. Air France need to look into making this more comfortable for passengers especially in this age when increasing security issues make longer stays at the airport more and more common.,lounge
217,Uncomfortable crowded shared with KLM. Not many magazines. Packaged crackers and cookies. Really a drag. No WiFi and no computers provided.,lounge
218,I fly all the time and have been a Koru Club member for years. Things have deteriorated to the point where I feel compelled to write this review. I can only assume that there has been some serious cost cutting going on air Air NZ as the food served seems to mostly consist of whatever is cheap. It is rarely tasty or nutritious. Then theres the actual state of the lounges - they're increasingly threadbare. In fact it has got to the point where the actual airports public areas are often a better alternative. Air New Zealand has really gone down hill quite suddenly. It is a really sad thing to watch.,lounge
219,Thai Airways uses Air NZ's Koru lounge at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport. TG462 departs at 0030 and it is sad to relate that this excellent lounge has very little to offer the business class traveler at the end of the day. Eats such as they were consisted of a very tired salad bowl a few biscuits and a bowl of fruit salad. In the drinks department there was no chardonnay only Marlborough Sav/blanc in the white range and one brand of red (cab/sav). I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices. I got the impression that the staff just wanted the Thai travelers out of the lounge ASAP in order to close the facility for the day. In fact the whole of Tullamarine Airport at that late hour is a shambles. It was a highly disappointing experience.,lounge
220,Crowded and loud noise. School holidays and full of children. Given the very permissive nature of Koru club membership and size of all the Air NZ lounges in NZ this is not a good time to be a business traveller.,lounge
221,The lounge has had a bit of an update which looks heaps better. I had the misfortune to meet the late night staff (duty manager I think) while trying to catch the Aus vs Fra rugby test before my flight to Singapore. A rather unpleasant experience all round. Not to mention the fact that she then got the departure gate staff to grill me when I boarded (as a result of the exchange in the lounge with the business lounge manager). Quite a miserable front to present to traveling public. I try to not fly Air New Zealand when I can help it amongst others for these reasons. unfortunately the Air New Zealand lounge hosts other airline business passengers so I will have to live with the luck of the draw as to who is on duty when I and others pass through AKL.,lounge
222,Initially looked pleasant. Air con did not work properly. When I asked why I was told that they have no control over the temperature that they had complained countless times to the airport facilities management but no improvement. Food was from the buffet reminded me of a British Rail buffet carriage from the 1980's. Upholstery was in a state of complete disrepair dirty and dilapidated. If the airport outside the lounge were not such a nightmare glorified shopping mall I would not have stayed there.,lounge
223,This lounge is small considering the number of airlines and flights it is supposed to accommodate. On my visit there were no seat available and I was forced to find a seat in what must have once been the business centre which is now a run down little room with a bench desk (no computers). Food options are limited but being breakfast there were scrambled eggs and beans available which weren't bad. Not a toaster in sight however. After the Auckland flight was called and those passengers had left the cleaning staff came out with portable vacuums and vacuumed for a good 20min which ensured there was no relaxation at all. This is a frequent occurrence in this lounge. Showers are available.,lounge
224,Air New Zealand use the Faa'a airport lounge in Papeete. Next time I'm not sure I would bother. The food offerings were poor. Actually mostly pre packaged snacks. If you want a beer or soft drink you'll be ok but don't expect any ice for spirits or mixers and don't dare ask a staff member for any ice. Staff are rude and abrupt. At least it's air conditioned unlike the rest of the airport.,lounge
225,Situated in the bowels of the terminal the ambience is gloomy and it looks very tatty and tired. Very uninspiring food (hot or cold) which isn't replenished as frequently as it should be. Dirty/used crockery stayed on tables way too long as staff were scarce. I visit this lounge fairly frequently and it's the same depressing experience. I don't know if it's bad feng shui poor design neglect or cost cutting but compared to other lounges even other Air NZ lounges this isn't one I look forward to visiting.,lounge
226,Very disappointing. No food lounge overcrowded. No plates or cups to get the limited food there was or make a coffee. Barista on duty but woefully out of their depth making 6 coffees. Air NZ staff happier gossiping around the front them providing assistance. No premium feel as overcrowded. Seating configuration forces people together and eliminates private space. Seen better lounges in Asia.,lounge
227,A very nice lounge. Good food and drink selection not especially crowded and good facilities. A few signs indicating where it is would be helpful having said that as it's a star alliance lounge I think?,lounge
228,I used the lounge prior to a flight to Hong Kong very full with several flights leaving. Just 1 staff was trying to keep the place clean. Food selection was dire. The hot option ran out and not replaced for over an hour. Even the cheese and crackers ran out. Leaving only some very unappetising looking muffins and scones with some soup. There was plenty to drink that is always well stocked. The lounge and bathrooms were reasonably clean. I would like to see Air New Zealand up their game with this lounge. For what is charged per annum for a Koru membership a lot more should be provided.,lounge
229,Fantastic lounge. Plenty of seat choices and a large food/beverage area. Staff keep the place impeccably clean –our empty cup/plate was removed what felt like seconds after you finished. We arrived just at the end of the breakfast service but you could still pick up some items off that menu – cheese & bacon muffins were delicious! The soft drinks were dispensed via a soda machine and my only quibble was that the glasses could have been done with being bigger. The ones there were more for adding a mixer to alcohol than someone just having a soft drink. Good free unlimited wifi too once you get the password from the receptionist on the way in.,lounge
230,Very pleasant experience. Good selection of hot and cold dishes. Above average selection of wines and beers. Clean and good shower facilities. Very handy after long haul intercontinental flight from Europe with international onward flight.,lounge
231,Currently at the Sydney Koru Lounge awaiting my flight. The facilities meet all the necessary requirements (incl showers internet ample space) and on par with that of the AirNZ lounge in Auckland. While the 90's styled furniture could use a facelift the quality of the food and service is brilliant.,lounge
232,Dinner menu - reconstituted chicken meat crumbed (called them chicken burgers) and wedges that were rock hard the only hot food on offer. One plate of cold cuts were the cold offering for the first five clients in the lounge - never re filled. My husband suggested Mcdonalds would offer more variety and fresher food. Very disappointing is the only thing we can say.,lounge
233,Visited with our toddler before a long haul flight and were very pleased. Along with a solid food and drink selection and announcements for all Star Alliance flights there is a kids room with plenty of toys crayons paper etc. we were there for an hour and had staff clean away dishes three times. It is basically the exact opposite of United lounges.,lounge
234,It is tired tatty and ill-conceived (where I was sitting I could hear at least two tv's simultaneously and the clatter of pool balls.) I picked up the seat cushion to try to make myself more comfortable - let's just say I don't think anyone has done that in a long time there were a fair few renegade peanuts bits of paper and dust under there. The carpets and fabrics are well past their best (I don't think cushions with holes in them is a good look). It is self service at the bar and buffet. There was very little choice of food and what there was unappetising and the presentation needed tidying up the platters were virtually empty the pancake machine was surrounded by cast-off pancake pieces. It really seemed like just the scraps were left. It appears that if you want to clean your teeth you ask the person on reception!,lounge
235,Air New Zealand use the Eva Air lounge and it is not very good. The lounge itself is big enough but all available space is crammed with tiny chairs. There is very little space to put your things and relax. Food and beverage is limited and toilets are dirty. Don't even think of a shower there isn't one. Good view of the Tarmac though. Found out later that Air New Zealand Business Class passengers can use the United lounge this would have been helpful to know before heading to the Eva lounge. Wished I had avoided this lounge.,lounge
236,Comfortable lounge with plenty of seating and partial views of the tarmac and runways. Good snacks and food on offer and great selection of drinks. Better than their flagship lounge in Auckland.,lounge
237,This lounge is a nightmare. It is leased by Air NZ and they apparently have no options but one is better off not to even go in. The food selection - none. The wine selection ditto. No showers. It is tiny and cramped and unappealing. When we were called for our flight and saw what was on offer in the terminal we wished we had just stayed there.,lounge
238,Originally attractive but now tired and shabby - carpets furniture fabric look like pub furniture in need of replacement. Food better than previous experience. Flight indicator board useless - our flight was 90 minutes late but this never showed. Staff were also unaware of the delay even though the airline had phoned me. Time for a major upgrade.,lounge
239,We really liked this lounge. Arrived about 5pm on a Monday night and initially there was plenty of room. It got busier later but it still had a nice ambience. Plenty of refreshments and snacks. One of the airlines better lounges and streets ahead of Auckland International lounge.,lounge
240,It is difficult to imagine this is a business lounge. Poor food & drink choice and press/magazine nearly absent. Definitely I won't recommend this lounge. I am a frequent flyer (Flying Blue Platinum for life). It is one of the worst lounges (maybe the worst) lounges I have experienced.,lounge
241,Qantas outsource the lounge in Noumea to Air Caledonie. Lounge a bit on the small side for two aircraft at once but very comfortable good runway views excellent food and drink selection and the one staff member very welcoming. All in all a good offering and a nice change from the standard Qantas Club. The only downside is toilet/bathroom is outside the actual lounge.,lounge
242,Spent 2 hours there on a Tuesday afternoon and was a pleasant overall experience. It's a good size and divided into several areas with a good variety of seating cell phone-free zone and kids play area. Food selection with a couple of hot choices and the usual cold fare. Trays of fresh baked cookies was a pleasant distraction. The beers and wines were above average. Customer service at the flight desk was friendly and prompt. My only gripe was the slow pace of table cleaning.,lounge
243,A Friday night at LAX it was awful lounge over crowded 2 Air NZ flights and A Virgin all departing within an hour no seats and screaming babies. If you pay to fly Business entry to the lounge should be automatic not on a first come basis.,lounge
244,Used this lounge for a Virgin flight and whilst not a bad lounge it's not a great one either and is certainly no Virgin Clubhouse experience. Decent selection of wines and self serve snacks but other than that the options pretty much amount to sitting and looking out of the window. There's just nothing inspiring about it - that said it's certainly more pleasant than the rest of LAX terminal areas.,lounge
245,Quite a comfortable lounge while not very exciting. Good selection of NZ wines cold meats cheese biscuits and bread with salad all self service. Several work stations with a rather slow internet connection. Staff polite and helpful. One grudge is the seating arrangements all of the side window tables are set for four people they always seem to be occupied by just one person who takes over the whole space confining the rest of the passengers to squeeze into the area in the centre. Not the best but certainly much better than having to use the dreadful facilities (or lack of them ) in LA airport,lounge
246,Lost a bit of sparkle over the last visit. Seems like every airline on the planet has use of this lounge. Drab and uninviting. Good drink selection. Food very average. Koru membership comes up for renewal soon-I won't be renewing.,lounge
247,Lots of changes since last visit. Most changes not good. Overcrowded and uninviting. No views of airport at all. All windows frosted!. Never again. Will not be renewing Koru membership.,lounge
248,Etihad are one of a long list of airlines which use this lounge. Inside it was clear that this lounge was in need of an overhaul. The furniture was tired and a bit grubby. Food on offer was pretty poor by Air New Zealand standards and replenishment was sluggish at best. A good selection of beverages and alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. The lounge has good views across the airport and good internet and wi-fi facilities. Showers nice and the attendants in the toilets and showers were better than in the catering side of the lounge.,lounge
249,I had not used this lounge for a number of years. The lounge is quite large with good seating - it was late at night so there were few passengers. The drink selection was good but the food was pretty bad only some tired cheese and ham on display.,lounge
250,It's looking tired colors that are drab but it has nice view of the runways okay food offering - very simple but better than many other airlines. It has good drink selection and lots of seats. I have used this lounge many times over the past 4 years and it's starting to look more and more tired. I also noticed that when flying United to LAX we had to use this lounge. When I switched the alliance about 2 years ago I started flying Delta and they also use this lounge so do some other airlines. As a consequence it can get rather busy at times and packed. The beauty about Sydney airport is that you might want to venture outside of the lounge and find equally good seating in many restaurants browse shops etc.,lounge
251,"The first impression of this lounge is that all the colour has been sucked out of the room. The ""colour"" palette is of dull mud brown gum-leaf grey and khaki. To add to the disappointment is that the windows are frosted over - no view. A better view is available in the public areas. The food is very basic simple presentation. Think of simple home cooking rather than restaurant quality. Even though New Zealand produces some excellent wines (and a decent selection available) they did nothing to present these in any way to encourage you to drink them or provide information about them. The bottles where just sitting in the fridge along with beers and soft drinks. The bathroom did not appear to have been updated in the past decade and it was not serviced frequently as there were no hand towels available - empty dispensers. Nothing was presented as a premium lounge of an international airline.",lounge
252,Air NZ can be a fickle airline - great today awful tomorrow. Its all about staff. The lounges are old and tired and the food selection has really gone downhill. No (or hardly any) reading material. Staff can make a difference. Empty food spots at the food counter due to slack staff - and they are very slow to keep the lounge clean and tidy.,lounge
253,A spacious comfortable environment friendly staff excellent food and drink plenty of space and seating was plentiful.,lounge
254,The new lounge is superb with excellent staff service. Décor is fresh and modern. Food and beverages fine but the best bit is the shower facilities now available at Raro (good if you've just come in from an inter-island flight or are in transit to LAX ).,lounge
255,Although inconveniently located in the basement of the Melbourne International Terminal and not easy to find on your first visit this lounge is surprisingly comfortable and peaceful. The food is acceptable and there is a good choice of drinks. Staff friendly toilet facilities are excellent. All in all not too a bad place to wait.,lounge
256,"We visited the Lounge flying from Brisbane to London and only wanted a cup of tea and a biscuit as we had been served a light meal on the flight from Brisbane. As there were no biscuits on display I asked a senior member of catering staff if I could have a biscuit only to be told that they were serving dinner and I would have to wait until 21.30 when the biscuits would be put out. When I questioned this I was told ""If I give you one everyone will want one"". Not the sort of service we would expect (or have previously received) from Air New Zealand.",lounge
257,Dated disinterested staff dirty crockery on several tables. Very poor selection of tired looking and unappetising food.,lounge
258,Space is quite tight in this lounge but if you are early enough you can get a seat. There should be a few more tables for those who prefer not to eat from their knees/laps. Welcome varies according to who is on reception. The range of drinks is great showers wonderful computer/internet access. Food is not great. Cold cuts and rolls. Hot offerings appear very late (within 30 minutes of boarding) and are dreadful. Soup is fine. Good range of snacks (chips nuts cookies). There is a big problem however with children - they run around unsupervised often using the pseudo-marble floors as a skating track (and this has happened the three times this year I've been in the lounge). There is no child-free area. They are also given unfettered access to the computers resulting in loud and raucous behaviour. Primarily it is their parents' responsibility but Air NZ should provide areas free from this noise and behaviour for those looking for a different experience.,lounge
259,Our flight left at 10pm the lounge was a zoo with no seating available. Staff were surly and unhelpful - we didn't try the food it looked unappetising. It was more comfortable outside in the general waiting area.,lounge
260,Excellent lounge from comfort to selection of food and beverages complimented by attentive staff. Different relaxation areas for different customers and area where kids are forbidden ensuring every traveller gets that opportunity to relax before the flight! Nice touch! It would be compliment the flight if the same wines in the lounge were served onboard international flights.,lounge
261,Clean tidy and well stocked for the small airport that it is. Plenty of space to relax and is not just one big open plan room giving the feeling of more privacy. Would happily pay to use this lounge although Napier is so efficient you never need to be there for long. Great for the business traveller. Only wish Auckland ANZ lounge could be half as nice.,lounge
262,This is the worst business class lounge I have ever encountered - difficult to find a seat tables piled high with dirty crockery and glasses - took more than an hour to be cleared. The food on a tiny counter was limited to stir fry or pasta in cardboard cups both of which were unpleasant - no Sandwiches savouries or salad options. If it weren't such along walk from the min terminal we would have returned there and paid for our food and drink. Business Class passengers deserve better than this.,lounge
263,I found this lounge very dirty with cups plates and spoons lying around the tables not collected by service staff. It was a Business Lounge being used by Thai Airways First Class passengers. In the internet room there was a major disagreement between two passengers. One of whom was talking loudly on his mobile phone making it impossible for the other internet users to concentrate. This matter was report to the lounges' front desk but they seemed to ignore the complaint.,lounge
264,We spent a couple of hours in the lounge yesterday and couldn't really fault it. OuR flight was departing around 2130 to LAX. There was plenty of food and drink plenty of seating wifi worked fine the back massage was excellent. Yes some of the furniture looked tired.,lounge
265,"Extremely dated and tired furniture messy and crowded. It's supposedly the Business Class Lounge but Premium EY passengers can use it too. Great for them but diminishes the exclusivity that Business Class should get considering the premium price tag. Arrived at the lounge at 10.15pm for our 11.45pm flight hoping to have a light meal so we could go straight to sleep once on the plane. Found staff clearing the ""trucker cafe""-buffet-style food table because ""dinner was finished."" Great. The only food available was picked-through cheese and crackers muffins (?!) and biscuits. Asked service staff for even a cup of hot soup but nope sorry not available. The coffee bar was closed as well and the only coffee/tea available was self-serve brewed. This despite the fact that there were so many people lounging around waiting for their flights - so much so that it was difficult to find any place to sit with any silence or privacy. Any free space on the sofas and tables were littered with crumbs used plates cups and glasses. Some staff were around clearing things away but hardly enough to cope with the number of passengers there. Very disappointing. Finally found a quiet spot to settle it near the back and decided to partake of the ""free massage"" for long-haul Business passengers. Approached the table presented boarding pass and was told sorry massage room was closing for the night. Quite a number of long-haul ANZ flights leave at night - including flights going to LON and LAX which have the highest fares. Why doesn't the lounge operating hours reflect this and have extended food/service hours to cater to these premium passengers? Considering this is Air New Zealand's main hub we thought the lounge here would be impressive which is why we came for our flight early.",lounge
266,Tired looking lounge with dated decor. Staff pleasant and professional. Limited selection of food & beverages. Washrooms provide very basic facilities and need updating. Screen for flights info only at entrance; no other screen is available elsewhere in lounge though boarding calls were made. Wifi available. Free massage available to Business passengers. One would think NZ has its best lounge at its hub - if you think that you will sure be disappointed.,lounge
267,"I recently joined the Alaska Air Boardroom after receiving a discount as an Alaska Gold member. I was quite impressed overall. The service was outstanding! The women working at the front desk were professional and went beyond their job to assist everyone who came in. Their smiles went along way for the numerous harried travelers. I think that Alaska could use a larger lounge area though - it felt a tad small but I am not complaining, I was glad to relax there. Fine service, great coffee and fun folks to talk to, what more can you want?",lounge
268,I was flying first class from SEA to LAX. Alaska is one of the U.S. carriers (maybe the only one) to grant lounge access to those flying first class domestically and not connecting to an international flight. Lounge was large (didn't realize at first there was a second floor). Selection of drinks and snacks was standard. Wi-Fi access was fine. Lounge was crowded on a weekday morning but I had no trouble finding a place to sit and plug in my PC or phone. I don't know if there were showers.,lounge
269,Flying Alaska Airlines from LAX to Vancouver Canada. Lounge in LAX was fine with quiet areas good selection of food to nibble on and nice bar offerings. Even better in Vancouver where hot soup beef stew wild rice and a wide variety of sandwiches and cookies were available. Nice area for self- service wine and other drinks. Very attractive display of food and beverages. Free wifi in both lounges.,lounge
270,Refurbished but with odd furnishings. Better than waiting at the gate. This location was recently refurbished. The lounge is the same size and layout the changes are largely cosmetic (mostly new furnishings). The tables/chairs in the center area are like patio furnishings - very narrow and extremely uncomfortable chairs. The chairs along the outer wall/windows are so low to the ground that it's like sitting in child's furniture - again very uncomfortable. In the morning food covers a wide range (fruit muffins coffee cake and even a machine that makes pancakes!). In the afternoon things like cheese and crackers. A limited range of complementary alcoholic beverages and some really good microbrews. Starbucks coffee. The bathrooms while small are clean and well-stocked. Nice view out the windows of the alleyway between the C and D concourses.,lounge
271,It is an up-to-date low key relaxing yet highly functionally business lounge with a large flat screen TV modern and comfortable dark color business tone sofas & tables food and beverage bar a clean restroom with hand lotion and half and full body mirrors 5 clocks of world time pc stations a laser printer a COPYING machine and a killer view for airplane and sunset. Staff on duty are experienced with people professional and skillful finding out what Loungers like me with a point and shoot camera are up to - taking photos of its remedies and breath taking sunset. They made me a single female Asia feel welcomed. Thanks them for making my 1st Board Room experience a positive one.,lounge
272,Very disappointed spent £60.00 for two tickets to this airport lounge. Food and wine poor. Toilet area and shower room dirty. Not worthy of the money paid. Such a let down to start of our long journey.,lounge
273,"We were booked into a United BusinessFirst cabin so we were given access to the Alitalia lounge located in the lower level (read as basement) of the terminal. The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (7:30 a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth. Don't plan on having a drink in this lounge - there won't be anything available. Our flight was announced and we made our way to the gate. This ""lounge"" was really sad. United should be ashamed that this is what they offer their ""premium"" passengers.",lounge
274,I'm writing from the lounge. What an absolute rip-off. I paid 30 Euros for the use of the lounge. It is loud and crowded the food is cold and with very poor selection. The wine was poured in a plastic glass and was the tiniest quantity. There's lots of staff but they don't seem to care about much. The wifi does not work.,lounge
275,The Alitalia lounges at FCO are the worst I've experienced for any major airline. They're appalling. The selection of food is so dismal that I don't know why Alitalia even bothers putting anything at all out there. Unfortunately if you travel through FCO these wretched Alitalia lounges are what you get stuck with.,lounge
276,The worst lounge I visited compared to Hong Kong Toronto Singapore Beijing San Francisco Bangkok that I have been. No windows no food available (time 11AM) only a drinks bar no windows male washroom had only two toilets (no urinals so you have to wait for a simple pee). Most disappointing was after an 8 hour flight I love to have a shower to refresh myself but they ran out of shower kits (no towels no soap no shampoo). Never go this lounge. I cannot imagine that Alitalia's lounge in Rome is such poor quality.,lounge
277,Never visited such a poor lounge before. Firstly no daylight as no windows in this lounge. Beside freshly made Italian coffee served by a friendly barman who has a little plate with some change to have every visitor understand what he wishes to receive this lounge has the smallest choice of food. Food choice goes from sweet Italian croissant to greasy couscous. Some other small pieces of bread are available but not worth to be mentioned. There is one toilet in male lavatory and this one toilet is dirty as are 3 showers of which two where mot working. Seating not bad and wifi works well but do not come to this lounge hungry.,lounge
278,Lounge was just fine: clean and conveniently located but overcrowded. Food and beverage was not you would expect from a business lounge in Italy: a few cold sandwiches basic soft drinks and house wine. Overall an average/below average lounge.,lounge
279,Alitalia lounge very much outdated as are the unfriendly staff. Quality of the refreshments and selection of such is poor. The lounge is on the inside of the terminal and has no windows it is like a maze and appears to have no predetermined structure.,lounge
280,Using this lounge in early mornings is really not pleasant: all you are offered for breakfast in terms of food are cheap and tasteless croissants and some other low quality focaccia type bread nothing else. Very sub-standard!,lounge
281,This lounge (accessible to other Skyteam travellers) is probably one of the worst I've seen in Europe. Colors are awful comfort is quite limited and facilities are just ridiculous - drinks server in a plastic cup with a very limited choice (Diet sodas not available!) nearly nothing in terms of food and you wonder what the barmaid just does there so she looks bored.,lounge
282,What is going on Alitalia? What is going on with business class at one of their hubs? This lounge is awful dark unfriendly. No food choices. No internet except it might have been there but did not work. Seats dirty.,lounge
283,A new refurbished business lounge inaugurated just 1 week ago. The lounge has free wi-fi choice of food and drink is fair with snacks and soft drink (and some italian wine). A very nice view on the runway and apron of the airport.,lounge
284,Had the opportunity to use the Alitalia Business Lounge at the JFK airport was pleasantly surprised by the lounge with contemporary decor and layout with enough comfortable seating space. Catering options were adequate. There were not enough power points to plug in a computer.,lounge
285,FCO to LHR in Business class. I was introduced to a small shabby crowded lounge which had no windows. The lounge was very uncomfortable so uncomfortable that I left after a while and went into the Departure area. The Catering in the lounge is not bad but there is a lot of room for improvement and there are no cleaning staff in sight.,lounge
286,One of the nicest lounges I have visited. The seating is excellent and plenty of room to find your own quiet space. The food and beverage selection is excellent. The area is clean and the location of the lounge is near the departure gate. Wifi connectivity is free and excellent.,lounge
287,"Flagship Lounge at LAX was good. Showers clean and well-stocked. They also had a nice little 4th of July spread with cake, special red, white and blue beverages. As for lunch, chicken barbecue, mixed vegetables including corn on the cob was served. Quality was poor and the chicken was very dry. Beverage selection was not as extensive as the Flagship Lounge at JFK. Lounge itself was spacious with excellent views of the apron. Overall, a decent flagship lounge, somewhat comparable to their Flagship Lounge at JFK although catering still needs improvement.",lounge
288,"This is by far  the best VIP Admiral Club we've ever been to. The ladies staff are very professional and efficient. The breakfast choices were First Class (best ever seen in an Admiral Club and we've been all over!).  We wish there would be a similar Lounge, with staff and culinary offer in the US - sadly there isn't.",lounge
289,"Concourse B Admirals Club at JFK was great. Plenty of open seating, great views of the tarmac and not crowded at all. Bathrooms were well stocked and clean. Service was excellent and personable. Like most US lounges, complimentary food is poor, but  it's a space where you can work, relax and be away from the main crowd. I also tried the Concourse C lounge which was smaller but cozier. Lounge in Boston was much better in my opinion. Great views, better service and showers were lovely. It was spacious, filled with amenities. I decided to buy one of the items on their menu, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was perfect. It was fresh and delicious, well worth the 9 bucks. Overall, both locations were excellent. Understand that the complimentary food is abysmal but it's a great place to relax and unwind. The service in both lounges was excellent.",lounge
290,Used this lounge as the BA lounge for a flight form MIA-LHR. Absolutely one of the poorest quality first/business lounges imaginable. Shabby old interior badly in need of a refresh unappetizing food choices of sad looking sandwich meats cheeses vegetables et all presented in old school trays/tins. Old school tech as well with half the power ports not functional. Not even remotely close to QF CX BA standard and BA should be ashamed to use it. With all of their traffic in and out of Miami time for a new lounge with modern interior and amenities. Appalling OneWorld Emerald prOduct that is truly substandard.,lounge
291,You do not get any food except of some kind of peanuts and apples. You get a voucher for a single beverage. I am a frequent Flyer and I never saw a lounge with less food and beverages.,lounge
292,"Good news: Spacious. Bad news: Everything else. Have found that the airlines in the US have totally lost their way. The lounges were originally a treat that has been allowed to go downhill as passengers are gradually reduced to the status of ""living freight."" Cheap food can buy some cooked food at outrageous prices no TVs in most of the lounge the publications are ""gimmes"": from marketing firms. Wifi well it is wifi. If you are going to charge me give me some value for my money.",lounge
293,I fly from JFK 2-3 times a year using the AA business lounge. It is overcrowded noisy and unpleasant. The 2 drink vouchers are tacky. In other European or South American airports you have self service alcohol displayed wine liquor soft drinks etc. At CDG in Paris the business lounge has fabulous capuccino and espresso machines with fresh orange juice and fresh pastry. In Vienna cooked food for lunch with pastry also self service. No charge for food or drinks. Too bad that the AA lounge is pitiful in comparison. For the prices they charge it is mistifying how bad the quality and service are. it has been always bad but worst since the merger.,lounge
294,I cannot believe that AA view this sort of service as First Class. It is one of the worst lounges I have ever visited in terms of service. It is basically a reasonably comfortable waiting area with minimal facilities for the customers who have paid high fares. AA really need to get a true perspective on what is expected by those paying for First Class! I will not be travelling with AA again until there is a review of the facilities provided!,lounge
295,Used the lounge at terminal 8 near gate 14. I knew the food offering was going to be poor so bought a sandwich from the food court and took it with me to the lounge. I was offered two drink vouchers but only used one for a pint. A waiter was available to take your drink and paid for food orders which saved you going to the bar. The free food offering was as expected very poor a few carrot sticks etc and cookies. There was some fresh brew coffee and make your own coffee from a machine which I tried and wasn't bad. As I was transmitting I decided to take a shower the shower room was functional but hardly inspiring but did the job. Overall if your expectations are low this lounge does the job but don't expect a Cathay Pacific standard lounge,lounge
296,This is not really a lounge in my experience. This is a corporate waiting room with a cash bar and makes no pretence of offering comfort or relaxation. It provides a more spacious place to wait for a plane and use WiFi. Compared to their code share partners British Airways and Cathay Pacific this is a real disappointment,lounge
297,"My wife and were taking the daytime 09.05 Chicago to London Heathrow AA90 flight. We arrived at the airport at about 06.00 (without having any breakfast at our hotel) and checked-in without problems. We passed through security and after a long walk found our way to the Admiral's Club lounge. What a disappointment the lounge turned out to be - American Airlines clearly has much to learn from British Airways on how to run a decent lounge. There was no food available that I could see (with the exception of a few bagels very small muffins and some pretzels) unless you paid for it. Furthermore there were no plates available - my wife had to ask for one and had to wait for almost ten minutes before it arrived. Just what does American Airlines think their business and first class passengers are paying thousand of pounds/dollars for? This practice of making passengers pay for food in the lounge is just cheap On entry to the lounge we were each given two vouchers for free bar drinks (how many people want bar drinks at that time in the morning?) from ""the pit"" - not high quality brands of alcohol. The lounge seats were comfortable enough but there were far too many dirty glasses and plates left on tables waiting to be collected and taken away. All in all our Chicago O'Hare Admiral's Club experience was very disappointing indeed. the service we received on our eight-hour flight to the UK was also very poor and the inflight food was absolutely terrible. It will be a very long time before we fly American Airlines business class again - we will ensure all our trans-Atlantic travel is with British Airways.",lounge
298,This is a very pleasant lounge. The layout is spacious. Furniture is lovely. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast food is above average - bagels and a toaster; muffins and a decent latte machine. Wifi is good.,lounge
299,Flagship lounge in JFK. Really feeling tired now for what is supposed to be one of AA's best lounge worldwide. Falls short of most top tier European or Asian airlines business offerings much less first class. Decent range of drinks but nothing special in terms of quality wines spirits. Basic food options one hot one cold plus snacks cheese. Good views across to Manhattan. Small and a bit cramped though chair arms worn through to the stuffing seating close spaced so no privacy. Decor dull universally brown. Poor selection of magazines newspapers. Just doesn't feel specie. AA is improving its on board products (new business class configuration is good) but the lounge has a way to go to get to BA Cathay etc. levels.,lounge
300,This is the Admirals Club in concourse G - American Eagle flights connect through G although all fliers can access this lounge when travelling from O'Hare. This lounge was recently updated and expanded and that is a good thing as the lounge was previously under equipped and over crowded. Expanded toilet facilities quiet area plenty of work space and well lighted. Receptionists friendly and helpful free basic booze but you pay for premium unless given cheesy vouchers why they don't just say show your international business/first class boarding pass for premium liquor is beyond me. All in all a nice environment.,lounge
301,"It's a comfortable lounge yet on the smaller size. Used it on several evening flights back to Europe. Though it serves as First Class/*Gold lounge for Lufthansa too and can also be visited by Oneworld Emerald/BA First Class passengers I never found it crowded in the evening. There is an open bar and a small buffet serving a good but limited number of cold and hot snacks. The only downgrade is the view into the terminal only. The way from the lounge to the European gates is quite long especially since the airport closed the ""shortcut"" through the duty free area. So be sure you leave the lounge in time.",lounge
302,Had a two hour layover on an international flight and was offered a single drink voucher. They really need to get with the real world. The AA lounges really are rubbish and so out of line with international standards,lounge
303,My sister & her son were travelling on first class tickets from LAX to Seoul Korea. They had a lay over in Dallas Texas & wanted to wait in the AA Airline Lounge but were refused entry because their tickets were purchased with frequent flier miles. I've never been refused entry to any Airline Lounge with First Class or Business class tickets purchased with frequent flier miles. Is this a new American Airlines policy?,lounge
304,Not a terrible lounge. It's quite spacious. There's just no sense of warmth or hospitality.,lounge
305,Limp sandwiches undrinkable wine but worst of all background music which is fine but then 2 competing TV stations on top. It's like a college sports bar. Poor.,lounge
306,Came in here in transit to Mexico after AA flight from London. Reasonably comfortable place with good views over airport. What seems somewhat mean and petty is that on checking in to the lounge you are given a voucher for just one alcoholic beverage. From a European perspective this is strange - especially since at AA Admirals Lounge in Heathrow there's an open bar. Most customers in this situation in my experience do not come into these lounges to drink the bar dry - but the option of a second drink without paying more would be nice - especially after buying an expensive business class ticket. On my way back to London through DFW used the smaller British Airways lounge and they have no one drink voucher policy. It's a pity AA do this - as their service from LHR to DFW is a great business class product in the air in the new 777 ER - probably best transatlantic.,lounge
307,This is one of the many places in the US Europeans just can't understand. Probably the worst lounge ever. It's more a waiting zone. No class. No style. No fun. No feel good. No relax. No nothing. Tip: get an Amex and go to their lounge near D17.,lounge
308,Last Sunday I walked into the Admirals Club at Heathrow Airport and walked out in a few seconds. It has the decor of a greyhound bus station from the 1970's. The nearby British Airways lounge offers some decor service and variety. I don't know how AA cannot see how poor their clubs are - it is a shame.,lounge
309,After paying for a business ticket I expect at least a free glass of wine. You have to pay for everything the food is bad and the bartenders worse.,lounge
310,"Thankfully on my return flight home that had a long layover at JFK I was able to use the AA lounge instead of the horrid BA lounge. There are actually 2 AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase. For that I might as well step out into the airport and buy the food of my choice.",lounge
311,"Large lounge with excellent array of facilities (including showers) and both WiFi service and several PCs (though on this visit the PCs were not working-- connection issues). You get coupons for a free ""premium"" drink. Food for sale is pretty much what you'd expect from an airport lounge (it's more a bar than a restaurant). The biggest downside is that the airport's main lounge can get crowded and finding a place to sit can be difficult at peak times (made worse by people using seats for their coats and carry-on bags).",lounge
312,American Express has made a smart decision by opening their own lounges and making sure that the customers come first. Today I had a massage and then amazing dinner. Thank you to American Express for caring about their members. ,lounge
313,I can't imagine any Admirals actually wanting to join this club. I've been in every one they have in the DFW terminals and none of them distinguish themselves. If you're looking for a quiet place to work this might be a good place though you can find similar places for free throughout the rest of the terminals. If you're looking for food or drinks the AC has possibly the worst food I've had in an airport - and you have to pay for the privilege. Whoever runs these places would do well to visit any of their competitors lounges it would take less than 10 minutes to see how far short they fall. I travel a lot and was reasonably excited to get be able to use the AC regularly - at this point I now avoid flying American when I can so that I can get status into one of the other lounges - AA doesn't make anything about being elite worthwhile other than getting on first.,lounge
314,Lounge design is dated tired and unimaginative. When I visited overcrowded and small. For a supposed flagship lounge it's small. Worst of all is the F&B offering. EVERYWHERE else in the world food and drinks are firstly of a much higher quality and secondly complimentary. I was given a couple of coupons for drinks but had to pay for nuts. Seriously. In short a lame offering.,lounge
315,I really struggled to find the lounge in the first place. Then I realised why - they are just to embarrassed by the service they offer to publicise it. 1 free alcoholic beverage which only - really and you do that by the humiliation of handing me a 'free drink voucher'? Is this really the executive lounge. Is this really what you get if you pay $5000+ for an international flight. Still I'm sure the wonderful free food will be great won't it - hang on you have to buy the food as well - really are you kidding me? I have a long haul flight where I want to sleep and not eat so eating beforehand is what I always do I have never had to pay for food in any executive lounge before. I guess it's time to avoid flying AA again and revert back to good old British Airways - well done BA you've outshone the competition at last.,lounge
316,Purchased a day pass to use at DFW/ORD/LAX. This review is for the lounge at ORD only. Lounge amenities lacking. The only self-serve beverages are coffee/tea/water. Free food consists of supermarket type cookies and two choices of apples. The latter are acceptable due to the fact that AA flights in Business/First more than make up for this with food/beverage/alcohol service. What was especially appalling about this lounge is the restroom/toilet facilities. AA terminal restrooms are usually crowded and dirty so I though that the lounge restrooms would be clean and inviting: quite the opposite! To start there are not private stalls like the lounges at DFW/LAX. I was carrying multiple carryon bags and tried to find a stall which would accommodate them. The stall closest to the wall was occupied the next one over had a broken lock the next one over was missing the hook in which to hang bags/coats and the handicapped stall had an almost one inch gap between the door and where it is supposed to lock. The lock maybe jutted out 1/16 of an inch and opened several times when I tried to hang my bag on the door hook. Making things worse there seemed to be no air conditioning in the restroom and a male employee kept pacing the area in front of the stalls with a bag of toilet paper rolls loudly conversing on the phone in a foreign language. All of the above factors made me leave the restroom and lounge early (sweating bullets by this point) for the family restroom outside of gate H6. Not worth the money paid and I would not pay the annual membership fees for such discomfort/lack of amenities.,lounge
317,Lounge was crowed  not comfortable and only real food available was for sale - outrageous given the cost of business class seats! One drink with a coupon.,lounge
318,I was at the AA Flagship Lounge on Wednesday April 17 between 4:00 pm and 11:00 pm. They stayed open an hour later than usual and my flight was delayed by almost four hours due to a storm that disrupted all flights at ORD. The lounge staff were outstanding on a very difficult and long work day. My lounge access came as a BA Executive Club Gold member (One World Emerald). Unlike the AA Admiral's Club lounges their Flagship Lounges provide complimentary food and alcoholic beverages. The light dinner served was very good including fresh vegetables a spread of good quality finger foods soup wines liquor and many non-alcoholic beverages. Although quite crowded that day it was very comfortable with a nice layout. Restroom facilities are limited.,lounge
319,What a total disgrace. You have to pay for drinks and any decent food. No working showers dirty and damaged furniture. How can American operate such a 'lounge' - when you have paid nearly $6000 for a ticket I'm not sure how AA work out that drinks should cost extra.,lounge
320,I fly a lot with Oneworld and have used the lounges of BA / CX / QF and others extensively. AA's Admirals club is clearly not in the same league. At first I thought that the economics of the huge domestic US market with its relatively low fares compared to Int'l long-haul might be the explanation. But then I saw that they limit access to passengers who do have a long-haul connection so that is not the reason. A very substandard product.,lounge
321,The new AA/JAL lounge at Narita is very large restful and well supplied with all the desired amenities: good food baths/showers a variety of sitting arrangements and very pleasant staff. Much better than one of the Sakura lounges we used recently.,lounge
322,One of the worst lounges. Wifi did not work Bar was closed TVs with nothing on - displaying Direct TV floating logo indicating subscription needs to be renewed. Dinner was cheap lunch meat and cheese.,lounge
323,ORD-PEK and was given security fast track vouchers at check in. Had a nice shower at the lounge. Only soft drinks and peanuts were free. All other food items or alcohol had to be paid separately.,lounge
324,I travel frequently via London from US. In comparison to BA Air New Zealand Air Canada or other airlines Admiral Lounge has definitely room for improvement when it comes to snacks and especially entrees. There is no variety of choices but also quality and taste is not very good. Most of the time I have been there there was about 10 minutes wait for refills for everything. Staff is not very involved either. I would suggest management to visit BA lounge next door and compare. I am very loyal AA customer so I am sorry that I have to write this review. Thank you.,lounge
325,There was nothing that resembled a breakfast snack aside from mini muffins which were stodgy. Coffee was sort of okay. The bar was not staffed for customary Bloody Mary's so it was easier to go outside. Not even bagels or bananas. Thank god I never ought a lounge membership or even a day pass.,lounge
326,Torn and tired seats. Coffee (burnt) and pretzels only - all food has to be ordered and paid for! As SJU is my local hub I have used this Admirals Club for years and have watched it get progressively worse. The bar/restaurant opposite the entrance offers better and cheaper food and drink. I for one am not renewing the Admirals Club membership!,lounge
327,I have to say that although terminal 8 is a new efficient terminal the lounge is not! Following the same penny pinching formula of most US based airlines you are given 2 tokens per passenger for complimentary drinks and after that you pay through the nose for both soft and hard drinks and food (tea coffee and water were free as were a few biscuits and apples). Compared to other airlines in Europe Australasia and the Middle East this is shabby. The lounge itself is pleasant if overcrowded. Seating when you can get any is very comfortable and many visitors were enjoying the US Open Tennis on several large screens. Food and drink policy really lets this and other US airlines down.,lounge
328,Pleasantly surprised with a 6hr unexpected layover in LAX this lounge was quite nice not deathly like other AA lounges I've visited in the US.,lounge
329,Late evening (9.35 pm) to Taiwan/Brisbane on Eva Air. Visited the lounge for some refreshment. Although the lounge was spotless and all used dishes were removed quickly the food available was dire. The sandwiches were curling and mini pork pies looked as if they'd been there all day. The Asian selection looked to be more appetising. Very disappointing.,lounge
330,Our company switched to American this year for more nonstop service from Chicago as for the past 6 years we have flown Delta but were tired of the connections. Having been a loyal crown club member / sky club I had expected AA to have a better club system and amenities. Although the club is very roomy plenty of seats wifi coffee / tea and minimal snacks you have to pay for everything. Staff at the front desk accommodating everything after that very disappointing. The club is located in the centre of the terminal thus away from most of the gates that I'm assigned so it is also inconvenient. I don't even bother going into the club any more. They should take a lesson from Delta's Sky Club - free everything nice people oatmeal bagels unlimited snacks - even though Chicago is not a hub city I will let my membership lapse!,lounge
331,Really disappointed. I'm Iberia Gold cardholder (Sapphire) and in my flight from JFK-ORD I used the American Airlines lounge in Terminal 8 and after in Chicago O’Hare. You get a voucher for one drink. I haven't seen this in any lounge around Europe and you have only some crackers cakes coffee and tea. Free wifi available but I was really disappointed for the lack of amenities. It is one bar more of the airport.,lounge
332,A haven after a long flight. Great showers and excellent English breakfast. Good Wifi and selection of papers. Not a lot of room but enough for those of us that were there. Good luggage space and friendly staff.,lounge
333,Horrible. Compared to the lounges of BA or Virgin the AA lounge is beneath contempt. Avoid at all cost. Bad food poor decor low ceilings and with nasty fluorescent lights. I cannot find a single decent thing to say about this place. Of course all of these comparisons are to international carriers like BA and Virgin. AA has just missed the standard of excellence and clearly does not care.,lounge
334,The Admirals Club is not really a first class lounge. It's only offered to first class passengers if you're traveling overseas. I was traveling first class Toronto to Chicago to San Jose - and they wouldn't let me enter. Out of curiosity I bought a 24 hour pass for $50 to see what was so special about this lounge. One would expect an airlines flagship lounge service to be very nice. The Admiral Lounge only offers crackers and cookies and there is no self-service bar. If you want anything more you have to pay for it. The bar is tended and they only offer cheap drinks and poor quality wine and beer. You have to pay for anything that actually tastes good. From the outside the doors leading to the lounges looks like heaven awaits on the other side. Don't be fooled. Amongst other things the staff is too preoccupied with their own personal concerns talking amongst themselves - usually about some negative aspect of their job. You have to wait for them to finish their personal conversations before they'll even look at you.,lounge
335,Sadly we were very disappointed with AA's Admirals Club lounge at Heathrow. The lighting (harsh neon striplights which cast a stark glare over the whole lounge reminiscent of a public lavatory) was horrible and as we had left home at a very early hour in the morning we were looking forward to a good breakfast like BA provide in their lounges. We found only pretzels and packaged biscuits available until some dry rolls containing awful tasting bacon were produced hours after we arrived and had checked in. Even the coffee was grotty and we didn't fancy alcohol at 7am. We were not impressed and our later experiences with Admiral's Club lounges at San Juan and Chicago were even worse. We shall not be travelling with American Airlines again.,lounge
336,"I decided to purchase a day pass to the lounge in Miami International on the way to Paris. I'd avoided it in the past because it was always a bit of a hike from the gate but I wanted to get some work done before my flight. My first clue that I'd made a mistake was when the agent at baggage check-in upon seeing that I'd purchased the day pass told me I was crazy for having done so. And she was right. It took nearly 15 minutes of standing at the counter in the Club to get my WiFi password and free drink voucher processed. That was disheartening but not as much as using the free drink voucher for a glass of champagne and being handed a twist off mini-bottle of sparkling wine. As you might expect it tasted terrible. The ""free nibbles"" that were provided were scarce and stale. And unlike at CDG nobody came to get me to tell my that my flight was boarding. There wasn't a single announcement made. So with 25 minutes to go before my flight I made the hike back to the gate and found that everyone had already boarded. This was a huge waste of my money and when I wrote to complain about it nobody offered a refund. Very disappointing.",lounge
337,The decoration of the new lounge is rather cold but I found it comfortable. Lots of snacks and sandwiches provided as well as a wide selection of drinks. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.,lounge
338,Have spent many a times in the Admirals Lounge in LAX terminal 4 and have been disappointed every time. No free WIFI provided and when you ask for a complimentary WIFI card that other Admirals lounge give out free here they do not provide them and tell you must pay. Seating is not not that plentiful or fantastic either. The complimentary food on offer are small muffins pretzels and apples which coffee orange or cranberry juice. Drinks must be purchased but they do give you 2 drink vouchers which is 1 extra to what you get at other Admirals Lounge in other airports. Very disappointing and don't even compare to other airline lounges like Qantas Club or other Oneworld lounges.,lounge
339,AMEX Platinum cardholders are supposed to have access to Admirals Club lounges. However when you enter the American Airlines Admiral's Club with your Platinum Card they make you feel like a second class citizen. They don't allow you to use the Wifi. In fact they segregate Platinum Cardholders in a lesser section of the lounge. Shame on American Airlines and shame on AMEX for allowing their platinum cardholders to be treated in this way.,lounge
340,Agree with previous reviewer that this is not what most people would know as a business class lounge. It is basically just a lounge. You get a voucher for one drink and a scratchcard for wifi - utterly bizarre. The snacks that were complimentary consisted of apples and some pretzels - everything else you had to buy. Would have been better off going to Starbucks outside the lounge - don't bother!,lounge
341,Great big oak doors on entry was a nice to touch for a grand entry. Nice friendly girls on the front desk. Inside was a bit tired and old but was a nice atmosphere. Good range of self serve beverages. Food was ok. Wifi and pc good. It was quite large so even though lots of people there was plenty of room.,lounge
342,"I used the facilities of the lounge on my transit from Chicago to Jakarta. I had to pay in JPY of USD50 equivalent since I was flying economy class. They only receive cash payment. It is quite expensive to my finding, but worth the money spent. The lounge is quite big and very clean. It comprised of two main halls. The first hall near the entrance is quite packed. The first hall offers both sofa and bar seating for lone traveler. However I found the bar seats are quite tight. There are power outlets at every seat. Food served at buffet station are quite limited, yet we can order a decent options of freshly prepared Japanese food at the noodle station. There are a wide variety of drinks available (spirits, including varieties of Japanese sake, coffee, and soda dispenser). I favor the coffee a lot. If you like reading, there are a wide variety of Japanese and international newspapers and magazines available. I found that the toilet and shower rooms are very convenient and clean. Luxurious amenities are provided to ensure you are pampered and refreshed for your next flight. If you decide to take a shower, be cautious about the timing as the queue is quite long. The attendant gave me a remote caller to notify me my turn. This lounge is very recommendable for long haul travelers to freshen up.",lounge
343,"This is the first time I have travelled Business class with AA so after a great experience in the lounge at Heathrow I was expecting great things when departing from Dallas. But oh how wrong I was. Firstly I was directed to the wrong lounge by the pleasant lady at check in. She sent me to the BA lounge. Anyway once I found the Admirals Club I was greeted by the most miserable man on the planet. ""do you want wireless?"" I was asked to which I was presented with a plastic card with a scratch off back. I was also presented with a ""good for one complimentary beverage"" voucher! One drink? For the amount I paid for this ticket I would expect more than one free drink. I have never seen that in a Business Class lounge before. Anyway feeling hungry I looked through the menu and decided on a panini. $9.99. No please Hello Or thank you from the man behind the bar just a ""sign here"". ( he didn't even take my voucher so I guess I may get another free drink after all). Food arrived fast as the bar staff cook it themselves. It's a bit like starbucks!! But it took someone an hour to clear the empty plate from my table. Taste wise? I should have eaten outside the lounge. Absolute rubbish food. Bought a second beer. Cost me $6 dollars. To be honest it's a bit like sitting in a pub chain not a Business Class lounge. I think I may stick to BA next time although this is a shared flight. Forget the wifi. It takes ages to type in a 14 digit code. Do what others do AA. This is not Business Class as I know it. I'm very disappointed.",lounge
344,The amenities are nice well laid-out and may have been recently renovated. However when it comes to food this lounge falls flat on its face. As others have said they have apples a pretzel mix and some cookies for free. Also it does appear there is a coffee machine of sorts which is free. There is a list of free alcoholic beverages (cocktails beer and wine) on the posted menu at the bar. The bar attendant made no effort to interact any more than the minimum and handles all food money buttons etc. without consideration for sanitation.,lounge
345,"I recently visited the ANA suite lounge at T1 Narita airport, as FF star alliance gold member flying economy. The reception service was excellent. Multiple people welcoming you with the most polite and efficient Japanese service. The lounge is huge and offers spaces for working or relaxing and also private spaces for sleeping. The food variety is not that much but just enough to be satisfied. You can also place an order for your choice of noodles, cooked on the spot for you. They offer also shower facility and concierge services.",lounge
346,I visited this lounge on 28 May on my way to Tokyo Haneda. Very nice lounge with nice view and plenty of light. Comfy chairs and plenty of power sockets. Packs left from previous customers were not clean up meaning that some desks had considerable amount of dirty glasses snack packs etc. Very good internet connection reasonably fast and reliable. Small selection of drinks. No food whatsoever only small snacks. Similar to American lounges not European or Asian ones.,lounge
347,It was the most over rated Lounge I have visited - not even up to a basic acceptable standard. Everything was shining in glass black and chrome but the food was old and even the fruit unfresh. The staff was tired and the only one that was actually doing something was a cleaner that hoovered the floor,lounge
348,This is the new first class Flagship Lounge recently opened - the previous one was a bit small but did have a nice clubby feel about it as did the Admirals Club. These new clubs have more of a hospital waiting room atmosphere about them - Flagship lounge is slightly better but not by much. Obviously the same design theme (hospital waiting room) was chosen by the designer. Slightly better selection of snacks and drinks than the Admirals but compared to BA Cathay etc it falls short. Staff welcoming and friendly lounge clean and bathrooms were also.,lounge
349,I have about 2million miles on American and transit through London a lot. I suffered though the interminable renovation at the Admirals Club at LHR and what a massive disappointment it is. It has all the charm of a bus terminal or hospital waiting area. Overly bright the seating is all out in the open so the sense is of an uninviting space that seems designed to set you on edge rather than relax you. The food offering is dreadful - little plastic wrapped awful cakes cheap wine and reconstituted juices. The staff are rude and officious. One only has to compare this with the BA lounges in Terminal 5 to see where they have gone wrong at every turn. This and the fact that they have now substituted the slow cramped 757 for wider bodied planes on a lot of the London flights just screams this is an airline who couldn't care less about its customers even those who are its premium ones.,lounge
350,Neat and superb. They even have free printing service high-tech and hygienic shower booths. Food can be improved but compared to other Star Alliance lounge like old Silver Kris at LHR terminal 3 and United Club this ANA lounge is much better.,lounge
351,Far superior to any lounge of US carriers at either Narita or Haneda. A wide variety of food offerings allowing one to have a complete meal before boarding. A bit crowded at times but the staff are helpful and courteous.,lounge
352,This is the most sterile boring uncomfortable lounge I have ever been in. Who ever designed this monstrosity should be forced to spend some time there. The Admiral's Club more appropriately would be the Seaman's Club is just as bad. The old decor was typically British and very nice.,lounge
353,"This is the new AA lounge at LHR - recently refurbished and what a disappointment. Like a hospital waiting room from a bad TV set. Uncomfortable seating in a horribly lit open area - florescent lighting is harsh - AA got it 100% wrong with this remodelling. This lounge holds at least 100 people and the mens room has 2 toilets! You need to manually turn on the water to wash your hands manually flush the toilet and exit via a grab handle door - like something from the 1980's. Having been a member of One world for 10 years now I would have thought AA would have learned from BA/Cathay what an international lounge should be. Very limited selection of breakfast items (tiny muffins and tiny fruit salads). Only upside was plenty of PC access - I am stunned at how wide of he mark this ""upgrade to our facility"" is. Shocking.",lounge
354,The Main lounge of American Airlines located between concourse H and K is well appointed staff friendly. Presented with one drink voucher each. The club was the same as it had been in 2000 when I use to frequent it. We found a place to hook up our laptops (we had to pay 14 USD each to hook up to the internet) drinks were expensive. We didn't eat any food the club was busy with kids running around.,lounge
355,It was great with all the new stylish shower room and the catering. I loved the food as well as the shower room. The only thing to improve on would be WIFI where I had to work.,lounge
356,Excellent wifi helpful staff large spacious decent F&B selection. One of the better star alliance international lounges and it certainly is superior to lounges outside Asia.,lounge
357,What an excellent lounge at their home base spacious good service and delicious food everywhere! I was impressed by the noodle bar where you can order your choice of hot meals. Great Wi Fi quite a comfortable experience. It's recommended to spend some time to experience this lounge if you ever fly with them or on Star alliance flights.,lounge
358,Without doubt the worst airline lounge I have ever used. I understand the lounge has been recently refurbished but the money has been wasted. The ambience is ruined by fluorescent lighting and it feels deathly quiet - there is absolutely no atmosphere. The furniture may be new but it is neither stylish nor comfortable the tables look like coffins! The food is basic cardboard tasting shrink wrapped in plastic and only snacks. There is no hot food. Beverages are worse. There were two bottles of red wine and of white both cheap quality - not what I would expect for such a ticket. Tea and coffee are of the do it yourself variety. Staff were disinterested and rather surly.,lounge
359,Great lounge. Difficult to get to and find it during the transit from other terminal due to Narita airport passenger traffic logistics and how the signs are marked. The lounge needs to open earlier. There are passengers always waiting from 630 AM  until it opens 730AM. Checkin tends to take too long even after you have a passport ticket and Admiral Lounge membership card! The staff is extra courteous. Nice to have a few exercise machines to warm up. The shower rooms have great privacy.,lounge
360,Very crowded and when I asked staff she mentioned she would help me look for a seat. She forgot about me. Food was okay. Shower is a nice touch but could be better. No service after that and worried about my luggage. Crowded and kids - I expect a lounge to be a quiet place to work or chill out before boarding a flight. If you want to work here forget about it. They have the famous ANA curry.,lounge
361,One of the best lounges I have ever been to. Great food and drinks courteous and efficient staff and excellent shower facilities.,lounge
362,Very slick and comfortable lounge spacious and quiet with a separate cordoned off area to rest on an armchair to soothing music and relaxing fragrance. Wide range of food choices including freshly cooked noodles on demand. Clean bathroom facilities (I did not use the shower) though there are no barriers separating the urinals. There is a separate business section with cubicles and comfortable chair and desk for you to work. Staff very courteous and friendly. The downside is there are no windows so no view of the outside and of airplanes. And the internet connectivity is poor/non-existent in certain areas of the lounge most frustratingly in the business work area!,lounge
363,Large lounge with views over the shopping gallery below or the tarmac. Plenty of seating areas quiet corners room for families pc area with free internet access. Serviced bar with sports channel on. Drink offer limited as was the food - peanuts and carrot sticks/sauce. Poor. Given 1 voucher/person for alcoholic drink from serviced bar way below expectations. Sandwiches have to be paid for from the bar. Only soup available upon request (and tipping). Reading materials very limited couple of newspapers and AA brochure. Obvious cost cutting by AA.,lounge
364,LAX lounge very good almost empty at 7am good drinks and basic breakfast foods. DFW was offered free alcoholic drink as OneWorld ticket - otherwise all to be paid for except coffee/sodas. Nice shower facilities in both lounges and staff friendly and professional. For US lounges no complaints but far from the standard of BA CX QF or JL.,lounge
365,I purchased a 1-day pass for 3 people in my family to use the Admirals Club in Dallas-Ft. Worth Admirals Club on the way overseas. I bought it online and ask the agent if there was free sandwiches snacks and alcoholic beverages. We wanted to get a cold beer and maybe cheese/crackers. The person said all this was free and when we got there I did not find any sandwiches free or alcohol. There was some trail-mix and pretzels cokes tea and water. The menu was an elaborate price to order anything else. We did not stay long and left. Delta clubs are better with choices of drinks (alcoholic or others) finger-foods and sandwiches. Do not bother with a 1-day pass at Admiral Clubs the only thing you get is maybe a fairly comfortable chair.,lounge
366,Decor is minimalist in the extreme but pleasant enough. Plenty of space and privacy with separate work areas. Hot towel and drink of your choice served. The Satellite 4 and Satellite 5 lounges are virtually identical so there is no reason to choose one over the other though the Satellite 4 lounge may be a little quieter. The food choices were uninspiring and not particularly extensive.,lounge
367,ANA moved operations to terminal 3. Ad hoc airline lounge located in the small cafe/bar next to gate area. Cafe provided free wifi access and served mediocre hot/cold snacks and alcoholic beverages. The cafe opens to the departure area and is not a lounge where one can relax work or read.,lounge
368,We arrived LHR after 11 hour flight from Cape Town. We were told that there was no hot water for showers. For simple washing up the ladies room was not even stocked with towels or soap. My husband reported that the men's room was filthy. When I finally approached one of the staff for entry to the shower room for a cold shower she was less than pleased at the interruption and seemed quite put out. Seating was shabby and tired-looking. Food offering was awful. There were 2 computers in the lounge occupied by a couple using them for twittering and net surfing.,lounge
369,Under renovation with partial completion. Standard US furnishings with reasonable atmosphere. Crowded for much of time there and other than nuts and juice everything had to be bought thus bringing down the scores. Internet access was on the blink.,lounge
370,"Worst international lounge I've ever been in. We're supposed to ""pardon their appearance"" due to their renovation. Why didn't they just set up card tables in the hallway? OK there were some alcoholic drinks on offer along with tasty items like cardboard muffins in plastic under the fluorescent lighting. Packed in for 4 hours with guys yelling into their cell phones the distant receptionists ignored all we waiting sufferers. Is it any wonder that American Airlines is having financial problems?",lounge
371,The Wine and Sake choice are excellent good quality. Choice of food is not extensive but okay. The lounge is very large and seating are plentiful. Showers excellent with individual amenities.,lounge
372,Decent lounge. It had a good variety of food. The comfort level wasn't that great but staff were nice and welcoming. Wi-fi connection was good but there was no TV.,lounge
373,Very large nice design good selection of drinks of all kinds (though the sake bar was not stocked properly as many bottles empty!) and a comfortable experience. The massage service is inconvenient. You cannot book ahead of time and massage attendants are busy when you try to book at the lounge when you check-in so it makes it impossible. They should get a dedicated staff in order to make it a real amenity not just a fake one. In its own right a decent lounge experience but does not compare to the JAL Sakura Lounge at Narita which is superior on all accounts.,lounge
374,"Have American Airlines not seen the way the rest of the world does it? What is a ""pay bar""? What is it with ordering and paying for food? After paying $12000 for a return business class ticket I do not expect to pay for a beer or a sandwich in the lounge waiting for a flight. As for the ""drinks vouchers"" stamped with a date - cheap and nasty! It is a real pity because the lounge itself is richly appointed. It is a warm and comforting environment spoilt by the need to pay for food and drinks.",lounge
375,Having flown AA for 20 years the Flagship Lounge/Admirals Club experience is one of my most disappointing with AA. The typical Admirals Club is rather tired has a poor selection of food and drink and are often crowded. Internet access has become one of the main reasons I keep my membership. The Flagship lounges (I have experienced LHR/ORD/San Juan) are better but typically quite small. It is mind boggling to me that they do not have one at their hub in DFW - but even these are nowhere near the quality of BA/Cathay for 1st class passengers. Their shower facilities are fairly decent with Chicago being recently upgraded but again Flagship do not have these - Admirals Club only. All in all not close to international standards with some of the lounges having totally insufficient bathrooms for the capacity of the lounge (ORD G Concourse is a good example - 1 toilet for men in a club with a 100+ capacity).,lounge
376,This lounge is always busy. It is a nice clean lounge in mostly good shape but starting to show some wear and tear. WiFi is great and there are lots of outlets to plug in. Seating is comfortable and it is usually quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to chill and read or do work. Don't expect to get anything decent to eat though. On my last visit (almost identical to my previous 3 visits this year) - which was more than 4 hours - the offerings consisted of one small EMPTY platter with sign that said 'Sushi' one small EMPTY hot plate with sign that said 'Chicken WIngs'. Food that was actually there consisted of a handful of pretzels with orange 'cheese' paste that tasted like wax a meagre salad bar with undercooked unseasoned flavourless potato salad and four large baskets of dry bread offered with jam and butter. About 10 tiny vegetable sandwiches made an appearance for 30 seconds - but they were immediately hoovered up by patrons desperate for anything decent to munch on. Three cups of vegetable rice also appeared briefly - but it looked and tasted like it was leftover from 3 weeks ago. Oh - and lest I forget two small cereal bowls with thimble sized cookies were offered for dessert. There are also cheap paper instant noodle cups always on offer. No proper bar (some beer on tap no wine to be seen no cocktails). Eat and drink before you come here.,lounge
377,Very good lounge for the US! Large decent food with some variety decent drinks on offer too. Free wifi access shower rooms available seemed new or newly refurbished. Only complaint would be that there were not enough toilets available. A good experience and something to look forward to when going in and out of LAX - a rather bad airport.,lounge
378,Really enjoyed this lounge. Lots of room free internet use. The food selection was great. There was sandwiches sushi hot noodles lots of snacks. Very comfortable. Not very many magazines to read though.,lounge
379,The lounge was great. Lots of room seats cubicles with computer (large screens) to check emails etc. Staff were friendly and helpful. To be able to relax eat (not so great) but lots of choices and shower I'd say this is great,lounge
380,Arrived around 9.30pm for midnight Emirates flight so was looking forward to eating a light dinner. Food and drink selection was extremely mediocre. There was a selection of overcooked tomato pasta a huge bread mountain with toaster which nobody touched. The salad bar and grilled vegetables were depleted and obviously the most popular. No dessert except some cut pineapple and sliced oranges. Pot noodles was obvious choice for Asian travellers. Compared to the business lounges in HK London and Dubai the Asiana lounge really needs to step up. At that time in evening the last thing we want is a carb overload. Suggest you cut out all the pasta and serve cold cuts salads and a decent cheese board some chocolates or dessert of some sort and not the plastic Kraft cheese on display. If we are playing business class fares then I expect half way decent food in the lounge. If I knew it was going to be this bad I would elected to eat in one of the restaurants in the airport but unfortunately everything closes at 10pm in Incheon Airport. On the positive side lounge was spacious wifi works and nice to have massage chairs. However can we have instructions in English as well please?,lounge
381,Roundtrip from HNL to ICN  experienced this lounge before returning to Hawaii. Due to security people watching the escalators was not able to lounge hop to other Star Alliance lounges located at other gates. Lounge is very large with several desktop computers available. You need a password given out at reception to access the internet. Be sure to explore both sides because they have different food available. On the right there was a chef dishing out a cold noodle dish and sandwiches. The left side featured pasta and sushi which kept running out and had to be replaced with different foods. As others have stated. the food choices are very limited and the cup noodles are very cheap looking.,lounge
382,"I had a chance to visit this lounge as I was flying business class with American Airlines that day. Came about 2:30 very quiet and lots of seats. They have laptops and the internet and wifi is good. There are rooms with massage chairs. Food was fine. They had a ""hot"" meal buffet at 3:15. Noodles Fried Rice and Tofu and vegetables. Also had some fruit cold salads sandwiches and kimbap. Coffee was fine. Overall I'd go there again if I had a chance.",lounge
383,Excellent lounge. Food is pretty good and cleanliness is perfect. Since they have expanded the lounge now it's not so crowded even on peak time.,lounge
384,Overall the lounge is comfortable quiet and has showers which is very nice. If you are lucky enough you can get one of about six cubicles which have some privacy and have foot rests so you can stretch out. I was disappointed with the food however. For this trip we used biz class lounges in O'Hare Narita Bangkok and New Delhi and they all had better food especially Narita and Bangkok. I will say the comfort level in Seoul was the best of what we saw.,lounge
385,I had a six-hour stopover in Seoul Incheon and used this lounge. The seats were comfortable the lounge was never too crowded and there was an excellent choice of food. My only gripe was the washroom. It was rather small but I was able to use the one in the neighboring First class lounge. To add some perspective I was on a trip from St Petersburg to Hiroshima via Moscow and Seoul and the lounge was a welcome contrast to the Aeroflot lounge in Sheremetyevo Terrminal D.,lounge
386,Very good lounge for depart from Seoul to LA. Internet service very good food ok. I do note the comments on noodles - yes a tad tacky but actually like noodles so not that bad really. Lots of the chairs are more stadium - rows all facing the same direction so number of seats that are more for 2 people to sit together is a lot less. Still overall not a bad lounge in a stellar airport. And yes Japan and Korea have the best toilets ever.,lounge
387,Great lounge. Very comfortable and nicely decorated. The food was lovely and continually serviced. Coffee great. Toilets were of a high standard with an attendant. High quality toiletries and very clean. We enjoyed this lounge.,lounge
388,Comfortable but a bit dated. Seats comfortable. Didn't like the food set out and ended up eating toast and peanut butter. Good coffee.,lounge
389,Extremely disappointed we were here a month ago and this place has got worse! Now they have plastic cups for wine! I suppose that is an improvement as last time we were here they had no wine! There are four types of lettuce to eat and cups of noodles tea coffee and soft drinks no beer a white wine a red and four types of spirits. I have read the previous reviews and the lounge appears to have got progressively worse. In all fairness to Asiana there is a sign up apologizing for things while they improve the lounge however I would say they have left it far too long before doing anything! As already mentioned the seating is uncomfortable and there are not many power outlets. We have flown business class with a lot of airlines and I can't fault the in air experience with Asiana however their lounge experience leaves much to be desired.,lounge
390,Business class lounge is quite spacious with lots of seats very welcoming staffs. Speedy Wi Fi. Food wise there really isn't a lot of choices it was strange to see so many cup noodles being stacked out kind of cheap to be offered cup noodles rather than proper hot meals (there was only a very few). Choices of drinks not bad quite a busy lounge at 5pm. All in all an average experience slightly underwhelming.,lounge
391,This lounge at 8am was very crowded. The chairs and couches were poorly designed and showing some wear and tear but lounge well maintained and clean. Limited choice of food and salad bar fresh eggs were available. Shower was very good. Great wi-fi and plenty of computers if you do not have one. Overall not too bad but it really needs some attention on seating and food selection.,lounge
392,The lounge was very overcrowded and struggling. Glasses and plates were left uncleared bench top tables were left uncleaned. Food and drink choices were limited and of poor quality. Frankly the lounge was unacceptable for a supposedly 5-star airline. Better quality seating food drink and WiFi was to be found outside of the lounge.,lounge
393,Nothing changed since I was start using with the lounge in 2010. They only serve little food for their guest. Asiana need to change their lounge service. I think they need to change this better to show their inflight menu.,lounge
394,Clean and spacious with friendly staff was my experience in the Asiana Business Lounge at Incheon. Good mix of food options in a buffet style and drinks were plentiful (alcoholic beverages were perhaps a little limited but onboard wines made up for it). Nice shower rooms available to use good variety of chairs and the lighting created a relaxing atmosphere. Pleasant venue to relax in before long flights.,lounge
395,Excellent state of the art facility to relax in before long haul flight. Lounge design was very attractive and made to look like a European library and the grand piano added a nice touch. Lighting pleasant and plenty of comfortable loungers massage chairs and relaxation rooms were offered. Food and beverages were excellent and much like those served onboard with both hot and cold options. Toilets and shower facilities were very clean and expensive bathing products were offered. Convenient locations to do some work and free wifi was also available. Staff service very pleasant.,lounge
396,An okay interior but some of the chairs are in substandard condition. Remember that ICN is Asiana's hub and I was expecting more. Food that was offered is not good. Two choices plus noodles. Only four choices of hard liqueur.,lounge
397,Asiana's Incheon First class lounge was certainly above average although I expected more considering it is their main hub. The lounge is spacious and luxurious with modern facilities. The shower rooms and toilets were pleasant and maintained well. The staff were immaculately presented and their service was exceptional. The main let down was the substandard food. Although there were still quality food and wine on offer it was nothing spectacular and the options seemed quite limited. Nonetheless the lounge is comfortable and allows for plenty of relaxation which is the main thing.,lounge
398,First time to use this lounge around 5 pm yesterday and it was fairly crowded. It provided us more than adequate facilities. Overall above average.,lounge
399,Very disappointed with Incheon Asiana business lounge. Limited food variety not enough showers tired furniture. Attentive staff but its what they have to work with.,lounge
400,Located on the 2nd level of the departure area the lounge is a windowless spacious room with a self serve bar offering beer hot/cold beverages and mediocre snacks. Private lavatory without any shower facility.,lounge
401,Clean and tidy lounge with comfortable seating this lounge is operated by Swiss Intl Air Lines. No real choice of food except a few cakes and a pretty poor excuse of a shower. Asiana could do with using a much better lounge to compliment their great airline. The lounge is also before security!,lounge
402,Mock European Manor is a little too mock but this is Korea. Friendly and attentive staff. Food for a first class lounge was mediocre. A lukewarm beef dish and a lukewarm prawn dish (these were the better dishes). Only wine was Californian Chardonnay although Moet was on offer too. Seating is comfortable massage chairs excellent and internet connection was very fast - shame seats do not have laptop power outlets. Lacking day beds. Overall compared to Swiss or Lufthansa first class lounges in FRA or ZRH this is lounge is lacking behind.,lounge
403,This needs a real sort out. Claustrophobic in the low ceilinged area the high ceilinged area is like being in a 3rd rate hospital waiting area. Seats uncomfortable food average drinks range very average.,lounge
404,Perfect lounge except for the very limited food offering. Shower rooms equipped with brand names amenities. Definitely one of the best airline lounges in Asia.,lounge
405,We transferred through Incheon. On the inward journey we spent a few hours at the lounge in terminal 1 - on the return the lounge in terminal 2. While they are both decorated and laid out similarly terminal 2 is newer. The shower rooms are a little nicer the layout a littler more varied and the business centre much bigger. While Seoul has a phenomenally spacious efficient and relatively pleasant airport there is more shopping in terminal 1 than 2. I compared duty free prices though and while there are savings on alcohol and tobacco many cosmetics and clothing were exactly the same as mall prices in Canada. Some of the areas Asiana could improve would be the inordinate announcement of flights; there is no escape from the PA. The quiet relaxing area is near the showers and bathrooms and cleaners area so there is always a din. The food offerings varied sometimes generous — roast pork hot soup vegetable salads — to scant such as sandwiches lettuce and dried noodles. Drink options not great not bad; no decent wine. Very pleasant staff.,lounge
406,Stunning facility. It's modeled to look like a comfortable manor library with shelves of books attractive lighting and a baby grand piano! Several relaxation rooms with loungers. several more with state of the art massage chairs. A TV/DVD room with large flat panels. Catering includes Korean tea service with traditional snacks cold bar with smoked salmon and duck hot bar with lamb and lobster thermadore. I wish the inflight catering was this good!. Excellent drink selection with proper barware. Business center with three fast computers. Showers and toilets with state of the art Toto technology (a translation card here would have been helpful!).,lounge
407,This lounge is about as old as the airport itself but is clean well furnished and has a perfectly good range of facilities. Food and drinks choices are fine and the staff are helpful and efficient. A quiet oasis of comfort in an otherwise terrible airport.,lounge
408,"Once you get past the dragon ladies at the gates, this is a fine lounge. The Austrian sparkling wine is fine, the food choices are abundant, and he windows are big, if not necessarily overlooking much movement. It should be noted that the catering service staff are both efficient and friendly.",lounge
409,"I am a frequent traveler and have an opportunity to sit in many lounges around Europe and the world. This Austrian lounge is at the bottom of my list. In fact, I don't think I will bother using it again as it offers less than the airport facilities. I was using it for an hour from 9-10 am on a Saturday. The choice of breakfast items is APPALING. Bread, jam, margarine or butter, cornflakes, muesli and apples. That was it! Not to mention that the milk was not marked as skim or full fat and there was only one pitcher of milk next to the cereals. No bananas, no yogurts, no cheese - those are the (inexpensive) basics of a lounge breakfast spread from Kathmandu to Lima airport lounges. Last week I flew through Munich and was amazed at their offering. I am so surprised that the airline of such high reputation offers such low quality of lounge services. They need to take a cue from Lufthansa! ",lounge
410,Small Lounge. Good view of the airport but not enough seating. Good selection of drinks. Stayed there for an hour and a half. Lounge crowded. Hot eggs cheeses spreads pastries. Entrees kept being warm and replenished. Very small rest area.,lounge
411,It's a small cosy lounge with good food. I really like the menu. One of the best non alcoholic beverage choice in the world. Unfortunately the lounge open quit late in the morning if you have an early flight you will face a closed door. It's a shame.,lounge
412,Visited the lounge 12th Feb at 6pm. It is difficult to find it going up and down the escalator and walking through long narrow hallway. It was packed as always. People standing only 2 pc but busy at all times. Basic newspapers option and basic food. Nothing special and pretty much the same as the old Sen lounge in the old terminal. One would expect that with a new terminal opened last year the lounge would be bigger and better. But no. Nice country and city but the lounge has not met my expectations.,lounge
413,I visited the lounge in the G-area (Schengen) on August 31 at 18:00-19:30. The lounge is nice and tidy and rather seldom overcrowded. The variety of drinks and food is good. Normally you will find both hot and cold food that is very tasteful. The seats in the lounge are not especially comfortable. The free WiFi is always troublesome and I have never managed to connect but the are free computers and Internet cables available. Nevertheless the WiFi should be improved or the instructions to be made clearer on how to connect. In the central area of the lounge there is a TV showing CNN. The volume should be adjusted to be just slightly higher since it is very difficult to hear anything if you are not sitting 1 metre or closer to the TV. In general I would however rate this lounge as comfortable and relaxing.,lounge
414,A nice but too small lounge during peak hours. Warm but not very good food at lunch. Good choice of drinks and coffee and choice of newspaper. Free and fast Wifi. Only 1 WC at the men toilets - prepare for queuing and a not so clean experience during peak hours.,lounge
415,Nice lounge small but modern and well appointed. A nice buffet with appetizers salads soup and hot entrees which were very good. Great selection of wines and spirits. 3 computers but internet was unreliable and I could not open most sites. Good selection of magazines and helpful staff. To use the toilets you must go out as they are shared with Business class lounge. You have to ask the receptionist to get into First lounge as the door remains closed during all time. Private with nice views of the apron. But a very hard to find lounge. And found Wien Airport confusing with no clear signs or information staff not a friendly airport at all.,lounge
416,Totally unacceptable! Old lounge at least had some charm. New lounge is worse in every aspect (besides drinks selection which is still fair). Food is a disaster. Toilets facilities a bad joke. Austrian needs urgently to improve this situation.,lounge
417,Austrian business lounge in the old terminal was not the best and not spacious but it was sort of cozy and food selection was decent Austrian business lounge in the new terminal is terrible. More space there but design is awful all in cold colors and strange furniture. The food is scarce and even worse than awful.,lounge
418,After a 12 hour flight from Bangkok I was looking forward to a hot shower but discovered that this lounge does not have shower facilities. First time I have ever experienced this. The lounge itself gives the impression that it is very tired and outdated. Food and beverages choices are very limited. Such a disappointment after a great flight with Austrian Business Class.,lounge
419,Never seen such a bad lounge. Minimal food & beverage selection one cold soup some dry salads and lukewarm chicken dish - was scared to eat then didn’t know for how long the food was in. The service was mostly in the kitchen with the result that tables been full a cleaning woman showed up and did a tour with a cleaning mob.,lounge
420,"I cannot believe that this is a ""business"" lounge! It resembles the inside of an Easyjet flight with uncomfortable seats wobbly glass tables and the second to worst food and beverage selection I have ever seen in 15 years of business travel. There was no red wine as they had ""run out"" at 1930. The quality of the spirits on offer appear designed to ensure that no-one drinks them: ultra low quality brands.",lounge
421,Providing plenty of space inside the lounge is a bit hard to find. Once inside there are several areas to choose from (relaxation entertainment business) with seating quality differing quite a lot between areas. Business area provides laptop ports (Power/LAN) pre- configured internet terminals Entertainment area club seats and a single TV and the relaxation area features some kind of (uncomfortable) armchairs with footrests. Moving between areas and to the lavatories requires the visitor to walk through a series of dungeon-like floors rendering the lounge layout a bit confusing. Snacks/Drinks selection average WiFi didn't work for me.,lounge
422,What a disappointment. Crammed full of people uncomfortable seating inferior food service and a bizarre cheap-looking bad taste décor. Staff very friendly and plenty of them at the welcome desk but not the seating areas. Very poor sanitary rooms. I was surprised that this should be the flagship lounge of the airline's home base.,lounge
423,Uncomfortable and inadequate number of seats. No couches to stretch out on. No showers. Single toilet for all passengers. Certainly not at all suitable for long distance layovers. Loud and noisy. Barely more comfortable than the main part of the airport itself. Does not add to Austrian's credibility.,lounge
424,Not the biggest lounge and it gets quite busy. Nevertheless very trendy and airy design. Stylish bar area with plenty of drinks and a small but high-quality selection of food. The Do&Co mousse au chocolat is worth a detour to this lounge! Llimited toilet facilities which force you to queue. No public PC available but wireless internet if you've got your own PC with you.,lounge
425,Lounge at Vienna is reminiscent of a Costa Coffee shop at a motorway service station. Very poor selection of nibbles available and themed contemporary seating which was only comfortable for a brief visit. Washroom facilities clean but basic and very old fashioned.,lounge
426,I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swissair logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swissair evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swissair lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.,lounge
427,After being deprived of a lounge in Santiago I was hoping to be compensated by the new lounge in Bogota. But I was rather disappointed. First the directions given by the checkin agent was go straight after security. Unfortunately there was a T-junction where the sign board had an arrow pointing UP. I asked a staff but the directions was confusing. Having heard that it was past the food court I look for this sign reach a dead end a construction area. So I backtracked and saw the food court UPSTAIRS. Going into the lift I pressed 2 the floor the agent told me. It didn't move. I try 3 and it moves. Actually the lounge is no longer after the food court but to the side especially if you take the lift. Next I looked for the toilet. I could see the female toilet but not the male one. I walked to the other end - still no toilet. Backtracked all the way to exit still no toilet. You see the male toilet is beyond the ladies but it is not visible from this direction or that. And there are no signs to overcome this. Then I went for the food. The spread was astonishingly poor. Many plates of ham and cheese. Some salad and juices. That's it for food. (I hadn't checked the alcoholic section.) I gathered some food and look for the cutlery. Not obvious again. After going around i found forks and knives but no spoon. I asked the cleaning lady and she obliged. Huge traffic during lunch time is no excuse Then I go the work area. Plugged in my video camera to recharge. Power light doesn't come on. I jiggled here and there. Still no power. So I waited for another table to be vacant. And there's power. So my verdict. Great potential. Lots of shortcomings which can be easily rectified. I hope Avianca realises that most people only use the lounge once. And some older people are not so mobile so they need good direction signs.,lounge
428,Avianca international business lounge was lovely when it came on line a couple of years ago. Tasteful decor imaginative catering reasonably comfortable. Since then it's gone sadly downhill. It is impossibly packed at peak hours food is pathetic (dusty sandwiches no plates plastic glasses no service) computers generally occupied by kids playing games the main lounge dominated by blaring TVs so work impossible. The best you can do is hug one of the little chairs in the front room and use earplugs. Another strange habit of the airline is to call US flights in the lounge while there is still a half hour line for secondary inspection at the gate.,lounge
429,Nice Lounge with friendly staff divided into 2 areas one with view over the airfield which is good as I personally don´t like places without windows. A real drawback is that they don´t provide plates not even plastic plates for the snacks one has to use napkins! Strange for a Business lounge. The catering itself is not bad but nothing special either. Self-service bar unlike the real bar service at Lima airport for example. At peak hours it can be really packed especially between 7pm and 9:30pm when many AV international flights leave. Nevertheless a nice place to relax after check-in and security procedure. Also not far from the gates short walk of 1-3 minutes. All in all good average.,lounge
430,"The lounge has just been renovated and it looks nice. It seemed to have much more space than it actually is. Food offered included Thai snack, Bakery and pastries items, as well as soft drink, juice, tea, coffee (Alcoholic beverage is not on the list, or made known to visitors). Seating is plenty and comfortable, free wifi offer and the connection is very quick.
",lounge
431,"Too busy to be an outstanding experience. Choice of snacks and cakes plus tea, coffee, hot chocolate and orange squash. Excellent wifi until the lounge fills up, then streaming from YouTube becomes unacceptable. Very noisy and squashed since these lounges are free to use for all passengers in Economy class.
",lounge
432,If you fly economy class and you can wait in a lounge for your next flight you are lucky because not so many airlines allow economy passengers in the lounge without extra charge. This was an extraordinary experience with free WIFI and snacks like mini sandwiches cookies popcorn coffee tea and powder juice. In fact there is a choice of more than 10 snacks to choose from. To be fair the Bangkok airways lounge in Chang Mai is slightly better with some extra ice tea and ice coffee plus a larger selection of snacks.,lounge
433,The Blue Ribbon Lounge at Suvarnabhumi is a disaster. First thing you notice is the heat. This is the second time I have to tell the ladies working there to turn on the air condition. First thing you see is a big stain on their carpet. The service is non smile and non attentive.,lounge
434,Fantastic. I wish Canada and the USA would adopt your service level. We enjoyed the relaxation and the refreshments in the lounges. We travelled to Phuket Koh Chang. Siem Reap and Koh Samui and downtown Bangkok. What a treat to be in comfort at airports where the staff need to be commended for their service.,lounge
435,Business Lounge at Suvarnnabhumi Airport by Bangkok Airways is great good services and variety of food to served and I have connecting flight from Munich at this Lounge has shower room for me to get fresh from long fight and relax at this quality Lounge.,lounge
436,The Blue Ribbon Lounge is located near departure gate 3. We were practically the only two persons in the lounge that day. We were greeted by a staff member who immediately brought us a small menu and took our drinks order. They have a selection of cold and hot snacks which you can help yourself to or order something warm from the menu. There is a massage chair tucked away in a room and another room with a small library and armchairs.,lounge
437,Located near Gate 3. This is a lovely lounge painted bright blue and white. It overlooks the beautiful manicured gardens of the airport. We were greeted warmly and given a cold drink. The staff brought us a menu from which we ordered a hot meal. There is a selection of cold and warm snacks which is self service. There is free internet and the lounge has approx 6 computers. There are no toilets within the lounge itself but outside the lounge near Gate 3. They are clean and tidy and have aquariums with tropical fish incorporated into the walls. The staff kept us up to date the whole time about our flight delay and came to personally collect us when the flight was ready for boarding. A very nice experience and can recommend.,lounge
438,Qualified customers will be entitled to use Blue Ribbon check in counter and Blue Ribbon Lounge once a month. The lounge is in the same area as economy class lounge but properly zoned. Selection of hot food and snack. Service is less smiling more formal and professional than economy class lounge. Nice looking decoration with touch of Thai. Facility include private relaxing room massage chairs WiFi Internet terminal and shower.,lounge
439,The lounge which provides complimentary hot and cold drinks and biscuits is available to all Blue Islands passengers. This seemed to surprise a couple of them who arrived looked around and backed out again as if they thought they'd made a mistake then reappeared looking rather impressed! I would imagine the lounge would be greatly appreciated if there was a delay although I haven't yet experienced a delay with Blue Islands.,lounge
440,The lounge can be accessed by all passengers flying with the (single class) airline. The lounge is comfortable and offers peace and quiet except during periods where two or more full flights are departing at similar times. Self service for complimentary drinks and snacks.,lounge
441,What a difference from our last visit to this lounge in April see previous review below. Lounge had only a couple of other passengers. Area and tables were spotless two pleasant staff in attendance served hot drinks by staff cakes/pastries and filled rolls on trays were covered with cling film an improvement from last visit. Newspapers magazines wi-fi TV screen was showing France 24. All in all a pleasant relaxing wait for our flight.,lounge
442,Four staff chatting amongst themselves unwilling to help seemed like they were doing a favour rather than providing a service. No coffee available for the machine. My wife had to ask three times same request made by another passenger we waited 15 minutes before a junior was sent out to fetch supplies. Staff unwelcoming and unfriendly as if everything was too much trouble for them. Food on offer:- pizza bites and salami filled hard bread rolls not covered unhygienic and unappetising. Tables tops messy with uneaten food and cups/glasses from previous passengers cleared and wiped only after complaints from passengers about the mess. The junior staff member carried this task out after being shouted at by senior staff in full view of passengers. Toilet facilities: paper towel dispensers empty offered toilet paper to dry hands by the attendant.,lounge
443,Flying on LX grants you access to The Great British Lounge at T1 for international departures. The lounge has great views of the airport and whilst visiting during breakfast had a nice and good selection of dishes available from cold to warm breakfast items. Lounge was very busy but there were still some seats available. Design is nice modern but also classic and typically British. Service was efficient but not really welcoming. The washrooms are terrible though. They looked very used and also seemed dirty. It is a good lounge and I hope that it will be kept in the future.,lounge
444,Considering this is Business Class it is very basic - TV blaring in the background limited food and refreshments grumpy staff and virtually no English language newspapers and no magazines. Very disappointed.,lounge
445,Separate lounge for Gold Card holders in Edinburgh but seems it is no longer used as last three times I have been there the main lounge has been closed and everyone is in the Gold Lounge. Selection of food and drink slipping over the last three years - just crisps biscuits cheese and crackers. Something hot during the day would be nice. Free WiFi involves logging in and providing details how hard can be it to have a dedicated WiFi with a password which is handed out to lounge members?,lounge
446,A long time since I used bmi and this lounge is really quite pleasant. After checking the services and facilities online at their website I must admit that it does not however live up to the claims they make. It was looking quite grubby when I visited - sitting in several different places the armchairs had crumbs and mess down the side of cushions and floor was not clean (to put it politely). Snack food okay but nothing exceptional. I guess they are measuring themselves against perhaps Lufthansa or United lounges and that is a benchmark far too low. Washrooms were okay although not much cleaner than public facilites here at terminal 1. Biggest disappointment was staff service - found them really quite offhand and lacking any customer skills or finesse. I see that Lufthansa is trying to get rid of bmi and that may be why the staff were so dismal and customer unfriendly?,lounge
447,The bmi Diamond Club & Business lounges are a retreat from the hustle of Heathrow and the dreary limited seating of Manchester. The seating in both airport lounges is ample it is not luxurious. There are places to work or relax and both MAN & LHR have great views of the apron. There is a good selection of newspapers and staff are helpful. Selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages but by no means a wide selection. Drinks are complimentary. There is a very limited food selection with pretzels and cookies the most regular options. For domestic flights from both MAN & LHR the departure gates are moments away. However on long haul bmi flights from MAN you are collected by a bmi staff member and escorted to the departure gate.,lounge
448,"Very poor. Breakfast selection- dried up rolls, to the point of hard. No other selection available. Had to ask for toast. All very tired and uncomfortable.",lounge
449,An update of a previous review from another customer. Three months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink. I asked at the check-in counter how is it possible that British Airways is not taking care of this issue. The person in the counter was very aggressive: 'Alitalia will not let us use their lounges - and the other lounge is already too busy'. The point is that British Airways is not taking care of the issue.,lounge
450,"I wish British Airways operated lounges that were more like this third party facility. The staff here in Vienna was polite, welcoming, explained all the lounge facilities to us, and was generally interested in customer service, Sadly, that is something that British Airways has lost in the past 10 years. This lounge is located before Immigration and the gate security, so you need to allow 15-25 minutes to board, subject to time of day. Great range of food and beverages in the lounge, nice seating areas, and the only downside was the lack of power facilities for laptop and recharging my phone.",lounge
451,"It's not really First Class. Should be advertised as Business Class. Food OK , plenty of seating, plenty of magazines, but way overcrowded when we visited. But First Class lounge? I don't think so. I tried the Turkish Airlines Business lounge in Istanbul -  that should be advertised as First . Having said that it's getting crowded in their lounge as well now.",lounge
452,"The British Airways lounges at Terminal 5 in Chicago are starting to look a little dated and tired now. There are two lounges - one small First Class Lounge overlooking the tarmac and the other larger lounge opposite next to the food court. The First Class lounge is small and cramped with very little in the offering of food and drinks. It is also looking dirty too with plates and glasses taking a lot of time to be removed too. The lounge although has nice views over the tarmac did get too busy so I went across to the other Terraces Lounge. Here they offer Pre-Flight Dining, as well as seating areas and again very limited offerings of Food and Drinks. This lounge does look cleaner but feels very dark as there is no natural light again the lounge is small but soon got busy with passengers as the departure time drew nearer.",lounge
453,"I used this lounge as a customer with Qatar Airways. Spacious and impressive offerings of alcohol but that's about it. Food on offer in the morning was abysmal. A few dry muffins, cereal, yoghurt and sliced cold turkey. No showers to avail of. It needs a better selection of food, preferably some warm offerings. Otherwise, it was adequate.",lounge
454,It is disgraceful that British Airways treats its Club Europe and Executive Cub members with such disdain and contempt. Two months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink. British Airways is enticing customers to use other airlines.,lounge
455,"Given Heathrow is BA's home base you would expect their lounge facilities to be of good order. Unfortunately that is not the case as my recent visit (outward journey) highlighted a number of failings, notably quality of food, overcrowding and general ambiance. This lounge is in serious need of a 'makeover' and a new catering company needs to be introduced. On my inbound journey I decided not to use the lounge and chose instead the general T5 facilities which were of a much better standard, albeit not free.",lounge
456,"This lounge is shared between many airlines, airside at the International Terminal. The lounge is spacious, with a few secluded quiet areas, overlooking the airfield. A friendly barman with a full choice of complimentary beers, wines and spirits. Nice choice of soup, sandwiches, cheese, cakes etc at self service buffet, but no hot meals. The lounge staff came round with mini cheesecakes and were happy to take your order for drinks. There are showers, but I didn't use them. Relatively short walk to the departure gates.",lounge
457,"I'm a fairly frequent visitor to this lounge. It is very busy, and you might want to go to the lounge on the south side or the Terminal 5B lounge. However, I find north side comfortable, clean, nice showers and restrooms. The liquor is quite good and is free. Food is nice, quite a decent breakfast. Light snacks the rest of the day. A good selection of magazines and speedy WiFi.",lounge
458,"A little difficult to find! Turn left after security, past London News (aka WH Smith) follow signs and it is on the fourth floor although that isn't very clear. Nice lounge large and pleasantly decorated with comfortable chairs and good position for plane spotters! We arrived around 1pm, there was a very small but nice fresh salad bar, soup, various sandwiches, and fruit, nuts, crisps all constantly replenished, the only sweet things were biscuits next to the coffee, as we were leaving at 6pm it seemed hot food was being served. A good selection of wines, spirits, soft drinks, juices, tea coffee, you need to ask for Champagne and I did a lot! Staff were all very pleasant and helpful. If you require power points the only ones I could see were at the back of the lounge in the corner opposite the wines and spirits. Personally I think there should have been some more 'dotted' about as most people require them.",lounge
459,"The old BA lounge at Schipol was small, cramped, had a poor selection of food and the staff were indifferent at best and unfriendly at worst.  The new lounge has managed to retain all of those
things, with an added 15 minute walk through a temporary tunnel from the terminal building. The only positive things I can say about this place is that the air conditioning works, and it
wasn't too crowded when I visited.  I have visited BA and partner lounges worldwide.  This one is the worst by miles. Not recommended, obviously.",lounge
460,New but cramped and uninviting. No pc's so if you don't have a laptop its a 15 minute trek back though the airport to find the internet facility. No information boards and staff offer no information unless asked. No update announcements. I arrived for a 6.50 pm flight and it was already known that there was at least a three hour delay but this was not mentioned ( the aircraft was still on the ground at AMS and had to do a rotation to Gatwick and back before our flight ). The flight eventually took off at midnight - during that time there were no announcements no apology and passengers were sharing information they gleaned by questioning the staff at the desk Even when they called the flight at 10.45 - presumably to turf us out of the lounge - after a 10 minute walk to the gate we found the aircraft was still disembarking. No offer of food vouchers during the 5 hour delay and the small plate of sandwiches soon disappeared around 7 pm leaving us with crisps or crackers. Really not good enough and should be scored zero for comfort food and service,lounge

462,Comfortable seating good wifi OK food and snacks. Parked ourselves in the little nook with the 18 year old Glenlivet didn't want to leave to be honest.,lounge
463,After reading all the reviews I wonder does BA actually have anyone reading these complaints? Have they ever responded? We travel to the USA often and when we do we use the lounges lately every thing has gone downhill in Amsterdam Schiphol selection was sparse. Heathrow too crowded people laying on couches asleep taking up seating space food selection was boring.,lounge
464,First the good points - its very large with plenty of seating and staff were friendly plus you can pay at door if not on ticket that includes entry (or have required membership level). Has lager on draught which you never see in UK lounges. On the poor side - if you are used to BA lounges in UK do not expect anything like Galleries for food and drink options - limited to small rolls with cheese or chorizo crisps or small pastries. basic stock of spirits and limited wines. Wifi signal was not great but that's not unusual in smaller airports.,lounge
465,Very poor. This is the 5th time I have been to the lounge and against expectations it was even worse than before. Overcrowded hot poor food lame selection of drinks inconsistent internet and a location which is remarkably inconvenient this is lounge to miss. Staff? What staff! No-one showed an interest and little action to clean refresh the food or make us feel welcome. Quite why BA continue with it I am not sure - I can only assume that none of their staff have used it.,lounge
466,Very good space excellent staff good views range of drinks disappointing and predictable food. The T3 lounge is very good - a wide range of different sitting spaces great views of the runways and aircraft delightful staff and a very strong range of drinks. Relaxed and welcoming. The minus is that the food offering has remained the same for at least 2 years and is modest in its range and quality - disappointing.,lounge
467,Quite a tight little lounge however adequate. I was the first in for the 9.20 flight to LHR. Nice selection of breakfast foods and drink. Papers and magazines all in order. The wifi was a bit slow and dropped quite frequently. Interestingly there were quite a few birds yes birds in the lounge that made it feel quite exotic. Obviously not a feature but watching the sing and fly around my head did make me smile. The lounge was between gates 22 and 26 and our gate was 11. Which did mean a bit of a schlep to the gate!,lounge
468,Absolute disgrace. BA should be ashamed (but obviously are not). There are enough negative reviews online - but it has to be experienced to be believed. Filthy torn upholstery. Food selection that resembles a self service cafeteria in a 1970's service station on the motorway. I was sent a survey by text from BA as I walked out of the lounge after being there for 5 minutes. I let them have my thoughts and they did call me. They assured me the lounge was going to have a multi million pound refurbishment - great but it doesn't help me and as I pointed out why is the lounge allowed to fall into this state of disrepair?,lounge
469,British Airways both in first class as the executive uses the new T 3 in Sao Paulo Business Lounge TAM. The Lounge has modest buffett slow wi fi showers with simple products and poor hygiene in both bathrooms which was causing me dissatisfaction. Totally unacceptable traveling first class and across precarious hygiene.,lounge
470,"There's nothing like a good lounge before your flight to make things easier - and this is nothing like a good lounge. It is the worst lounge I've ever used. Having said that it isn't quite as bad as some other reviews across the Internet might lead you to believe. We arrived about 90 minutes before our British Airways flight from Bordeaux to London Gatwick and the whole Club Europe check-in process was very friendly and smooth. We were issue with an invitation to the lounge; you then have to go through security (no fast track of course!) and present your invitation to the ""Cafe News"" on the airside. They will then give you the code for the lounge's front door. You have to enter this yourself; the lounge has no staff at all. However the member of staff at the cafe was very pleasant. There is a vending machine serving hot drinks which I found acceptable but be aware that the default choice adds sugar to everything which I did not want. There are a couple of local wines in a cooler and various spirits with soft drinks and mixers in the cooler. A few food items are available; in our case since we had a morning flight there were some quite fresh croissants and pains au chocolat which were actually quite good. The seating is rather old but not uncomfortable. The lounge itself was mercifully quiet which I suspect is usually the case for what is most probably a mainly holiday destination. Some of the tables could have used a quick clean but nothing serious here. So all in all if you can get a good price for your business class seat it may be worth it for the additional pre-flight comfort but anything like standard business class prices are definitely more than it's worth paying for this lounge.",lounge
471,I visited the new British Airways lounge yesterday after a 25 minute treck across the roof tops of the terminal building exposed to the elements. Do bare in mind that the 25 minute treck is just to get the new lounge you will need to add at least 40 minutes to get to the departure gates & through security. The new lounge appears to have less seats than the old lounge it is narrow & cramped & you still need to leave the lounge to use washroom facilities. The refreshments are very poor nothing as improved in this area so still a very poor selection of drinks & food & snacks. The furnishings are trendy as opposed to being comfortable & functional as well as being cramped with little privacy if you want to have your own space. At the moment I would not entertain visiting the British Airways lounge until the building work has been completed towards the end of 2015 as it is not worth the effort it takes to reach the lounge after check in or leave the lounge to get to the departure gate. Once again British Airways have missed the boat on redesigning something which could be wonderful for their passengers.,lounge
472,Read some poor reviews but we had a few hours to wait so thought we should at least try the lounge. The hostess was pleasant and promptly checked us in and provided a quick overview. Lots of seating was available so we picked a couple of seats with power outlet. The seats were well maintained clean and comfortable. A couple of ladies came around frequently to clear dishes and we found them very pleasant. Food was a nice potato and leek soup and sandwiches. Sandwiches weren't the best. Good selection of refreshments. Would happily return.,lounge
473,I use this lounge five times a year. Today I arrived from a 12 hour flight and had a four hour stop over before my next flight. I arrived in the lounge at 8.45am - It was heavingno comfortable chairs to sit in and relax after a long flight dirty plates cups and rubbish left on most tables. I went to the ladies loo which had a long queue but very clean - and for a shower which I did not have to wait for which were clean and very good. Sadly the lounges area seems to be full to bursting on most occasions when I visit - it used to be a quiet relaxing lounge but on two occasions I have left and used my Priority Pass for the quieter No.1 Lounge downstairs. BA really need to enlarge this lounge as it really doesn't cope with the volume of passengers using it anymore. The staff are always helpful but there does need to be more of them in busy periods. The food is of very good quality and choice (much better than on the flights).,lounge
474,British Airways T5 in London has Business Lounge Galleries. The Lounge has good buffet with different options generously offered alcoholic drinks wifi good and wide with fast workstation.,lounge
475,A shocker - quite the worst lounge I've seen anywhere. BA should be ashamed to have it's name outside. The ambience of a suburban bus station no food you'd actually want to eat limited drinks options curt reception staff and grotty toilet. The Harrods cafe just outside is a better option.,lounge
476,On entering the lounge we received an excellent welcome from a very pleasant hostess who checked us in promptly. Heading to the seating area we were again welcomed by another staff member who escorted us to a couple of seats by the window. She took the time to explain the lounge layout and brought us some water. Throughout our stay the staff were extremely pleasant and attentive clearing glasses promptly and refilling water glasses. The lounge was clean and seats comfortable and in good condition. Electrical sockets were conveniently located for access to power. Food was soup and a good selection of sandwiches can't comment on quality as we didn't partake. A good selection of tea. coffee beer wines and spirits were available.,lounge
477,"The new Lounge in the Schengen Terminal at Brussels airport  is modern and practical. The food and beverages are varied and of very high quality. There is plenty of cooked food, sweet or salty. The internet connection is very good and you can even borrow ipads in case you don't have a laptop.",lounge
478,Nice lounge in T3. Comfortable and ample seating. Beer available on draft which is a nice touch. Wine spirits and soft drinks. Wifi speed good enough for emails and web browsing and easy to log on. Sandwiches light snacks and soup. Only downside is that there is no view. Please be aware that to get from the lounge to the G gates involve getting on the shuttle train - so allow enough time. They make announcements when the flight is ready for boarding. I can confirm that the lounge does have its own toilets.,lounge
479,This lounge is an absolute disgrace. Lounge filthy toilets disgusting and food terrible. Baked beans curry and carrot soup what a cliche. There is some really serious work to be done here.,lounge
480,This lounge is a disgrace for a national carrier at its home hub. The lounge is way overdue for a refurbishment - the chairs are old tatty and falling apart. The food is plentiful but poor and self service - so breathed and coughed over for hours.,lounge
481,Perhaps this was due to poor research but I came to Brussels on Eurostar intending to fly back to UK after visiting The Loft - Brussels Airlines' new and much touted lounge. I write this sitting in the somewhat less publicized lounge in pier B the gate area for non Schengen departures. There is a good view of the airfield but the windows overlook the less interesting apron and I have yet to figure out where today's active runway is located. The rest rooms are located outside the lounge and like the United Club at EWR there is no hot water in the sinks. Lest I seem like a whiner I should commend the food and beverage offerings. The cava sparkling wine is excellent and there is a broad selection of tapas sandwiches and soup. At. The moment anyway there is adequate and comfortable seating.,lounge
482,Newly renovated large light nice view on the tarmac good food and beer on tap plenty of amenities. Definitely above most european / short haul lounges.,lounge
483,The lounge is bright and very spacious shower is clean with towels food is plentiful with great choices and staff are nice and courteous. Now if they could do something about the dilapidated Terminal B lounge.,lounge
484,Just awful. Way too many people. Food is terrible. I tried to have a beer but all of them were too warm. Plus there isn't much of a variety much Heineken Tiger or nothing. Wifi is slower than a 1990's dial up internet line. I travel quite often but even though I'm a Silver Member I rarely use the lounges anymore. I head elsewhere.,lounge
485,Dreadful new lounge. There is a 50 minute walk to the gate! Via a temporary roof walkway (till April I was told). By the time you have trekked over the roof of the airport it is not worth it. The lounge is small sparse cramped. Few facilities even the toilets are outside. Only breakfast items were small cartons of corn flakes. No milk provided. Thanks BA. Awful lounge not worth the visit.,lounge
486,Way too busy staff that begrudgingly go about their jobs. Beginning to think that my membership of the executive club is now far less appealing than it used to be. I have travelled extensively on business and generally have a far better experience with Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Even the Lufthansa lounge at Heathrow has a better ambience. BA need to take the time to give this place a much needed uplift. If customers paying premium fares help BA survive more needs to be done to ensure they don't go looking for the premium service they pay for elsewhere.,lounge
487,The new lounge is four times the size of the previous one at over 1200 square metres. Reviews here dating back more than 2 months are therefore obsolete. New lounge very nice in all respects tablet computers are provided for free no password needed for internet access (which used to be limited to one hour previously) Belgian beers on tap mousse au chocolat made of Belgian chocolate - in other words a treat !,lounge
488,"The Star Alliance lounge at Brussels airport underwent a refurbishment over the past 6 months. The area has probably tripled and has spacious areas with lounge chairs tables to work comfortable leather couches a quiet business area a sleeping area with ""nap boxes"" lockers for luggage and an improved food selection. The lounge has a luxury feel to it and reminds me of other high-end lounges.",lounge
489,Very overcrowded small space. Hard to find a seat. No privacy. Very dirty. Wifi with a coupon for 1hour only but it takes 20 mins at least to connect and what you get is hardly enough to Google something. No real food. Heavy thick and fat buttered sandwiches soup and beer. No toilet!,lounge
490,Lounge was dirty (very dirty) when I visited at 0915 on 27th January. Staff are beyond rude and standards have continued to drop every time I visit. Have they had a pay cut as they appear seriously unhappy and make an effort to be difficult and offhand to us paying customers. Sadly this is something I have noted onboard as well during last 2 long haul flights to Chengdu and back. Product is well below Asian airline competitors and Lufthansa and Air France are ahead of BA in the business class game. Amenities catering and service onboard Club World are a joke and I guess the only satisfied travellers are those who have never flown other airlines apart from BA.,lounge
491,All of the ambience and comfort of a hospital waiting room! Cramped with uncomfortable chairs arranged in squares with very few tables for plates and glasses. Poor selection of unappetizing food No showers. No Flight information displays. Very difficult to access with wheelchair - lifts are behind padlocked fire doors. The most disappointing lounge I have visited.,lounge
492,Busy busy busy. More people in the lounge than at the bars and restaurants outside. Nowhere to sit for the first hour then table sharing and bag stacking for the rest of my stay. Staff couldn't keep up with the mess and catering demand. Aside from the 12hr delay the BA lounges have gone downhill fast. Loud and messy chaos!!,lounge
493,The terminal B lounge is so small and overcrowded. Also it is unbelievable to have wifi only valid for one hour. The condition of wifi usage is much worse then many of the African airports which the Brussels airlines serve. On top of that there are no bathroom nor shower available in the Terminal B lounge.,lounge
494,Worthless lounge. Too small too loud no real food except for some toast and cheese. Luckily sufficient Belgian beers but that could not compensate for the lack of free wifi. You would not believe it still exists in the 21st century.,lounge
495,Awful! No still bottled water - have to use a machine linked to the mains. Only a hot soup type thing and no other hot food. Dried sandwiches horrible coffee. BA - why do you bother with this lounge?,lounge
496,I visit Toulouse nearly every week and this is the worst airport lounge I have experienced. Food selection poor drinks even worse which is unbelievable given we're in France - where's the wine? Interior decor is horrendous. The yellow red and green faux leather seats make it look like a 'wacky warehouse'. Its a shared lounge too and therefore way too cramped. BA nearly always has a full flight whenever I travel to TLS so I would expect them to help push for a lounge that its business travellers deserve!,lounge
497,"Quite backwards. Not a single gluten free item not even crisps or peanuts. Very few of the seats have AC outlets. The staff tries their best. WiFi cut off. Too small and too crowded. You wouldn't believe that this is the ""capital"" of EU.",lounge
498,Just after security for B gates but upstairs from the main concourse. Nice enough lounge although not especially large. Limited seating and very small side tables and the toilets are outside of the lounge in the walkway. Food selection was sandwiches cold meats and cheeses with soup and pastries. Large fridges full of drinks and food quite a pleasant place to spend an hour before the flight home.,lounge
499,An OK lounge designed for short stays and the 5 hours between my inbound and outbound flights did drag even with a couple of walks. Staff are friendly wi-fi good and complimentary plenty of Belgian beers and other temptations. The food is pretty odd though - a massive tureen of soup a plate of dry and dull sandwiches and some plates of cubed salami and cheese.,lounge
500,Disappointingly cramped crowded and bare this was a surprisingly disappointing lounge with a paucity of refreshments and even these were in short supply. Given the significance of Schipol I was a little taken aback by the limited facilities (no loos inside the lounge for example). The staff were courteous but little else shone.,lounge
501,A good experience. Helpful staff good refreshments in terms of quality and variety. The lounge itself disappoints a little as it has no bathroom facilities inside it and it is a rather plain room but more than adequate. Wifi was good and I suspect much could be improved by altering the seating plan and providing washrooms. Great location next to security and a pleasant enough stay.,lounge
502,A totally different experience from the usual BA self service arrangement which can be great or not so great. Everything is served from cooked to order meals in private booths to drinks at the bar. Generally of top class hotel fit out and a great 'outdoor' terrace overlooking the concourse. Get there early to fully enjoy it. The only annoying matter was the irritating background music. Switch it off!,lounge
503,Very cold welcome by the two SN ground staff the lounge is better than international B gate lounge. The catering is poor for a Star Alliance lounge only some dry cake nuts and vegetables - no sandwiches soups and hot dishes. Nice assortment of Belgian beers and beverages. For washrooms you have to leave the lounge and return to the gates entry section.,lounge
504,What a disappointing lounge. Seems to be designed for short haul where you might spend 30 mins at most in the lounge. Quite cramped. no washrooms or showers (use public facility outside) no free wifi and very old and tatty computer terminal that has a very slow internet connection. Food comprises a few apples biscuits stale bread rolls and rather poor tub of soup! Staff are polite on entrance door but nothing else - they are silent offer no help and apart from talking to belgian customers we noticed they were actually quite rude to many foreigners. A polite description is that this lounge is a dump!,lounge
505,I liked its quietness. Its cosy with comfortable sofas. Food options are limited but just enough for my needs : rice pasta chicken curry meatballs cheese salad bar snacks. Wine selection is small and champagne is self-service. The staff are attentive at reception and in the lounge. They come around with hot canapes.,lounge
506,My partner and I spent a relaxing couple of hours in this lounge. The atmosphere was quiet. Big comfy sofas and chairs a good range of soft drinks beverages and alcoholic drinks available as well as fresh fruit and yogurts in the fridges canapes sandwiches nuts and cakes. We didn't need wifi so can't comment on whether it was available. Previous reviewers have stated that the lounge doesn't have its own loos not true it does. But we did not see any showers available.,lounge
507,Pretty poor for a first lounge. I've used plenty of the major airline's first class lounges: Qantas Cathay Emirates American etc: and considering this is the First Class lounge at BA's flagship terminal; I was pretty unimpressed. Firstly the breakfast was awful. The scrambled eggs on the buffet were more milk than egg. The coffee was out of a machine: no trained Barista and the menu that was available was very limited. I also had to queue for the toilets: not a shower. Just the toilets. Maybe this can happen in the business lounge but you just wouldn't expect this in first. Then it's the little things. I sat in quite a comfy seat with decent views but I could not charge my phone as there was no USB amenities. Also they had international power outlets but not Australian/New Zealand and I had already packed my adapters in my checked baggage. These are the type of small items that with a little thought can make a big difference to one's comfort whilst travelling. Sorry BA but you've failed. I'd look at what Cathay Pacific have done in Hong Kong and Qantas in Sydney. I love the Qantas first lounge in Sydney but Cathay's first class lounge in Hong Kong is spectacular.,lounge
508,Lounge comfortable snacks and drinks sufficient. unable to relax due to noisy kids and to top it all a mouse was spotted running around near our bags. Flight delayed by over 2 hours this lounge closes at 8.30 unfair if your flight is delayed and you have paid for this privilege!,lounge
509,Really much improved my last visit here in May. The food was plentiful and of good quality the wine selection improved and the cleaning service coped well with a busy lounge. The dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy - no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct. Helpful staff and wonderful views. Excellent - well done on the improvements.,lounge
510,"I don't like this lounge at all, it is too small, very dated but at least it is clean. My worse complaint is the food choice is awful and very limited, even if you travel in the morning there is no breakfast food. I just wish they would update the lounge and specially give us proper foods. I still strongly recommend Cathay Pacific Airways, but not the Cathay Pacific lounge at Cebu!",lounge
511,BA has no control over this lounge as it is shared. Unbelievable that a brand new terminal would have shared facilities. It is an open bland fairly uninteresting space with a section 'cordoned' off for First Class pax. Food and drink the same for everybody. What is totally ludicrous is that in a brand new lounge in a brand new terminal there is only one men's and one women's toilet. Utterly inadequate.,lounge
512,I had an evening flight and the lounge was overcrowded. I travelled with a friend and it has very hard to find a place to sit down. There wasn't much space to relax in either once you found a spot. The plus side is that there was a good selection of sandwiches and decent WiFi.,lounge
513,"Flew BA to Prague and prefer the Cathay Pacific Airways lounge over BA. Food choice was excellent, chose the made to order noodles and they were excellent. A hot buffet was also available and I tried malaysian duck curry and it was great. My companion had carrot cake and cheese and was very happy. Decent choice of drinks and we drank about 4 flutes of the excellent Verve Clicquot champagne. My companion also had a shower and commented how lovely it was. The lounge had great views of the apron and runaway action.",lounge
514,"The new lounge has just opened, huge Improvement on the old one. Open to all one world pax. The lounge is neutrally decorated with a good Thai menu. Not much else on offer at the moment but I think they're working on it, great bar and lots of staff around . Well done Cathay!",lounge
515,Too busy and small. Lounge used by a variety if other airlines hardly any seats and food drink not so good. I often don't bother. Considering there are so many flights from BKK to HKG I think a bigger lounge needed. Stop messing around with a first class lounge and just make a better one for everyone.,lounge
516,Very poor low grade business lounge. No champagne on offer unless you ask for it !! But very few staff around to ask. It looks tired with stained upholstery. Seats arranged in long functional rows along the walls - no different from the departure lounges. I normally fly Qatar or Emirates - they both know how to do Business Class -BA has either lost it's way or lost interest. It's been dumbed down to accommodate silver/gold card economy travellers. Fly Qatar or Emirates - even the Virgin Upper Class lounge is better than this.,lounge
517,BA run lounges are usually good if sometimes overcrowded. Third party lounges like this vary. This one was dreadful - very little food limited range of drinks no computer access and very hard to find. I gave up and went to a bar to get a drink.,lounge
518,"This is a fairly small and somewhat claustrophobic lounge. The chairs are comfortable enough. There is just about enough choice of drinks (no Campari) but an extremely limited choice of ""nibbles"" or anything else to eat. Also a very limited choice of newspapers - no Daily Telegraph for example. Our Amsterdam lounge experience was made singularly unpleasant by several lounge users conducting business into their mobile telephones at the top of their voices. After over half an hour of this anti-social behaviour my wife got up and told them that they were making so much noise she was unable to concentrate on the book she was reading. This lounge needs an area reserved for those who wish to utilise mobile telephones at the top of their voices! We were glad to leave the lounge.",lounge
519,Tiny room. Lots of flights from BKK to HKG so already busy really not much there. Also other airlines use it. They really need a bigger one considering the amount of daily flights. Not much food to choose from.,lounge
520,Atmosphere is acceptable and the noodle bar is a plus. But the noodle bar is hiding behind the washroom area and didn't even know the first time I was there. The food selection is small. The internet speed was as I tested about 3-5 mbps it's ok I guess. Staff courtesy is not so good. Nobody came to greet me at the lounge entrance. Some don't speak good English.,lounge
521,Surprisingly small in size and lack of the luxury atmosphere which you would expect from an international airport which the airline has three A330 flight serving daily. Choice for breakfast items were limited - especially hot plates. I don't see chance for big refurbishment of the lounge due to relative size of MEL airport.,lounge
522,"After Fast Track - instead of being able to walk about thirty yards to the Business (Club) lounge passing through the First Concorde Lounge - you have to walk left descend a floor walk back under where you have just walked and then take an escalater up again. What a nightmare. I am a disabled passenger but I was not allowed to walk through the Concord area to the Business Lounge - I was not amused. Certainly a user-unfriendly route from fast-track to the lounge. The Business Lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly ""tired"". They have stopped providing the Daily Telegraph and at the drinks area they have stopped providing Campari. The chairs and carpets appear very ""well-used"" and some of them appear to be well beyond their ""sell-by"" dates. Food provided was so-so - good croissants but uninspiring lunch choices. When this lounge opened it was wonderful. Today it does not hold a candle to the First Concorde lounge (which I have also used on eleven occasions). Although I recommend the lounge it is with some reservations.",lounge
523,This lounge has a real problem With US Airways in Oneworld all AA and US travelers are trying to use it as it is much nicer than the either the Admirals Club or US Airways lounge.Staff are in the unenviable position of turning people away and denying guest privileges to keep it within the fire regulations for capacity. BA clearly needs to restrict to only BA travelers and EC card holders. JAL has no problem doing the same with their First lounge in Chicago due to space limitations.,lounge
524,This lounge is outdated needs a total refurb! I would be less than impressed if I had paid club prices for the experience. Furniture old staff rude drink and food selection exceptionally poor. You have to share a bottle of coke and the glasses are filthy and scratched and no wifi!,lounge
525,Agreed with comment made by Michael before considering the amount of BKK-HKG flights the lounge could really be improved. Small food and drink selection nice seating areas and it's quiet though. Hard to find. The Emirates lounge here and even the priority pass one next door are superior. Toilets are outside and there's loads of room to have one inside.,lounge
526,The lounge is a small place on the Mez floor between the main airport area and the gates in Section G. It is dingy and without much of a view. The furniture seems shipped over from HK as leftovers from the renovation there. Sat through chairs and chipped and worn tables. So it does not matter that people place their feet with the shoes still on on the tables. Staff are friendly (natural for Thai) but that is the best about it all. Drinks are standard only snacks and cup noodle soup on offer here. If you have the option move over to Louis Tavern lounge for superior service and experience.,lounge
527,Very impressed with the quality and service received at all lounges. Amazing washroom facilities and quite areas for relaxing between flights. Food and drink was also very good!,lounge
528,I think the earlier reviewer of this lounge must have been in a temporary lounge. The new BA lounge is spacious probably bigger than it needs to be and looks great. A much superior offering to what BA has to offer in other airports eg BKK and MIA. The wine selection is limited with two whites two reds and a champagne. Usual selection of beers and spirits. Good selection of sandwiches and cheese but no hot food other than Heinz tomato soup ! Staff are attentive wifi is good with decent speed. There's is no business centre and no tv screens so overall the lounge is a quiet area.,lounge
529,I want to like it so much as it was the first lounge I ever used - but it is tired and needs a considerable refit and upgrade. Positives: good supply of drinks (of all types); nice open space; free wifi which is efficient. Negatives: wine was not cold; food was poor in terms of variety (just cheese/ham/salad) but fine in terms of quality; unusually the staff were not attentive or helpful (but that is unusual); poor seating space and decor/furniture really needs upgrade.,lounge
530,If you don't like one lounge you can try another and another and another. There is something for everyone and service beverages and calm environment.,lounge
531,This is the newly refurbished Cathay First Class lounge opposite (though upstairs from) Gate 2 at Hong Kong airport. I was disappointed and its very average. I understand the new interior is sleek and modern but when you look beyond that there's not much below the service. No snacks unless you go into the Haven for some crusty buffet food and waited several minutes for a shower attendant to appear and when she did she screeched something at me in Cantonese from the end of a hallway gesturing to a refurbished (though standard) shower you would find in any lounge. Aside from the furnishings I would suggest the Business Lounge next door offers more and certainly the QF First Lounge in Sydney or the BA First Lounge at LHR T5 are far superior. All in all what a disappointing effort from Cathay.,lounge
532,Quite comfortable but generally the size of the lounge is too small and feels a bit crowded and hot. Good wifi connection but not too many food choices available. Staff friendly and very nice. The lounge is located near the gates and flight information is provided which is convenient to passengers.,lounge
533,A bad anomaly at the fairly new Ataturk International airport in Istanbul compared with the excellent Star Alliance lounge which I have also used in the past. a scarred wooden floor with large dark gouges dirty armless chairs very closely spaced together dingy lighting a very limited and poor food and drink selection few information monitor screens located far from the boarding gates. In short a disaster rivaled only by the American Airlines lounge in Lima Peru.,lounge
534,I had the opportunity to visit the BA first class lounge in terminal 5. It was really crowded dirty and untidy. I had to make queue to use the bathroom. The food from the buffet was poor and the white wine was warm.,lounge
535,Many good features but let down by wifi (you have to pay after 15 minutes of free use) and food (quality is fine but variety and quantity is disappointing). The drinks selection was very good the comfort certainly good and it was a busy though comfortable atmosphere.Not that easy to find it is friendly enough. The wifi issue is a considerable downside and the food was simply not plentiful enough - long periods without anything other than chips/crisps and then narrow range. Drinks - of all types - were plentiful and good quality. Seating was comfortable though the lack of power sockets was a little surprising.,lounge
536,I heard HK CX first lounge has been renovated but was disappointed. It was still under renovation Entrance staff at ground floor was rude particular the male staff. They treated different passenger differently as well. If you could stay there for a while observing the differences between passengers you will understand where I am coming from. Depends on the time you might be lucky to find a seat. Food at noodle bar is terrible I had some fried dumplings - it was not really cooked some parts still raw. Very limited food option tired staff working at lounge. It cannot compare with QF first lounge in Sydney not even match QF business lounge. Poor service poor quality of food limited space what else left with this lounge?,lounge
537,Floor to ceiling windows with a view of the apron and runaway and choice of food was excellent this included a buffer style English breakfast with some Singapore noodles but we opted to have some made to order soup noodles - superb. There were other snack and dessert items and a good choice of soft drinks. I had a raspberry juice which was just divine. If you are a One World Emerald member I seriously recommend this lounge at LHR T3.,lounge
538,Cathay Wing Lounge across from gate 2. Nice friendly welcome when entering the lounge. Short escalator ride that opens into a very airy setting with multiple seats and hostess around. Ample refreshments snacks and actual meals. Hot tasty and abundant. Lounge is located within easy reach of of Cathay's gates in that area. Plenty of space to work WIFI easy to access. One of the best features is the noodle bar. It is located on the opposite side of the entrance. 5 Choices and great. If you have a chance to try it -you will be very surprised and glad you took the time!,lounge
539,The lounge is modern and does its job. We had a morning flight at 10.30. The lounge was very crowded bordering on congested. It is self service throughout. Being full made it a bit difficult to obtain food and drinks keep a reserved table and relax T the same time. There are many worse lounges. However BA should look at extending the area or redesigning to make the lounge less congested.,lounge
540,It is a bit daunting when you first arrive but staff are surprisingly friendly and seemed genuinely interested in looking after you. Good baggage storage so you are free to enjoy. Three parts: the dining area - discreet cubicles with fast service and excellent food; a main lounge with various types of chairs to suit all needs; and a 'veranda' like place that although it is inside has excellent views across the tarmac. Seating here is more like a conservatory. (Spa and showers computer/business room but I didn't try any of these). Well worth getting to the airport 2hrs before your flight. Wifi a bit slow but adequate.,lounge
541,The newest lounge is quite impressive. Fantastic staff (waiting & counter staff) and a great selection of food. The solus chairs were also enjoyable as they allowed me to work and be comfortable at the same time. The waiting staff were employees of The Peninsula Hotel and made for a great experience.,lounge
542,The staff here are friendly; the lounge is comfortable with excellent food. The noodle bar is a must try. The lounge is becoming more congested which can make finding a seat difficult. My main gripe is the truly terrible wireless connection speed. It is now quicker to use my mobile's 3G service than the CX wireless. This has been getting steadily slower over time and now it is just not worth using.,lounge
543,I found this lounge quite good for a short stay. Comfortable seating not crowded and good food/drink options available. The smoothie of the day and fresh panini sandwiches were a treat. One downside were the small restroom facilities which could be a problem during peak hours.,lounge
544,Food quality is well and a variety of selection offering at the lounge. I enjoy the noodle bar and also dim sum. Staff are friendly and often look around to see if passenger need to be taken care of. The sleeping room is quiet to take a rest. The seat area like small balcony giving a room of privacy. ,lounge
545,This lounge is a room nothing more! Four serving people hovered around a minimal amount of stewed food totally disinterested. Only sweet was ice-cream at the other end of the lounge. It didn't even have a flight screen! No place to leave luggage unlike some other BA lounges. Food was terrible: tough and tasteless. In the end I went to the Qantas lounge - you are allowed there and they were wonderful - they have a chef to cook for you. BA's lounge is a disgrace no views of the apron - only of arrival lounge/immigration. Haphazard boarding meant long queues and no fast-track so a long wait at the gate security.,lounge
546,This lounge is generally OK but it wasn't when I arrived late morning on Sunday. It was overcrowded overheated and unpleasant. Most newspapers were unavailable. Having paid hundreds of pounds extra to fly Business on holiday I left immediately and ended up in a Cafe Rouge. I realize that lounges get busy at certain times of day but I don't understand why conditions need to be worse than at your average Starbucks or even (on this occasion) Café Rouge. I suggested to BA that they give me a refund. They said they valued my loyalty but no. Oh well. Fortunately the flight was good but I am assuming lounges are taken into consideration when evaluating airlines for stars and recent lounge experiences have made me wonder if BA's four stars might be too generous.,lounge
547,What a shock. The lounge was dated in Poor disrepair and quite frankly grim. It needs refurbishing badly and it was way too small for the number of travellers using it. The No 1 Lounge is way better but they could learn a lot by visiting the Virgin lounge at Heathrow - it Is a million times better. BA need to buck their ideas up here!,lounge
548,Very ordinary. Feels like it is in the dungeons of the airport. Limited selection of food drinks. More entertainment available within the terminal.,lounge
549,Showers were good with nice extras. Did not find any computers would appear they only provide wifi. Asked for a cabana but told that's only available in the first section of The Wing. Overall quiet pretty spacious and well positioned.,lounge
550,Very basic. Overheated. No shower. No fresh fruit or vegetables. No muffins cookies or crackers. Limited selection of indifferent hot food. Both coffee machines were broken.,lounge
551,The lounge is on two levels. While the lower floor is noisier it has a good noodle soup bar. On balance the lounge is acceptable but not as good as most other business class lounges.,lounge
552,Food quality is very superb. I love the noodle bar. The dim sum selection and beverage selections are plentiful. The shower rooms are very nice. There is plenty of room downstairs although as others have stated it can get extremely busy at night when the flights to North America and Australia are leaving.,lounge
553,Despite having a BA Business Class ticket I was declined admittance to the Business Class Lounge! The (very helpful polite and just lovely) lady at the BA Customer Service Counter informed my that my ticket wasn't the right type of Business Class ticket to gain access to the lounge. Given the fact I have a One World First Class around the world ticket I have to ask what exactly is an acceptable ticket! The gentleman at the Business Class counter (also terribly polite and most sympathetic and helpful) informed me that QANTAS Frequent Flyer Club members are no longer allowed in the BA Lounge as they no longer pay BA for the privilege! British Airways pick up your game.,lounge
554,Great lounge relaxing and food generally good - have noticed cuts in premium spirits crisps and total lack of decent magazines which is a shame as BA makes all it's profit out of its business class passengers.,lounge
555,I would agree that this lounge is often overcrowded and looks rather frayed now. Staff were friendly on my visit and quick to offer service. Table service good though food selection has lost its shine compared to a couple of years ago.,lounge
556,Cathay Pacific Lounges at HK International Airport used to be a benchmark but have lost their edge over past 2 years. Overcrowded with wear and tear generally showing throughout. Noodle bars in Business Class lounge or seated dining area okay if you can get a table. Most of the times better to grab a bite to eat outside and use the chairs available at the gates. Cathay needs to take care of premium customers better or accept losing clients.,lounge
557,Just a dreadful experience. The staff was discourteous rude. They ignored my plea for help to correct the wireless problems claiming they could not speak English or help me. It was as if I was troubling their time when I was flying first transpacific and waiting for another lengthy flight onward. The shower was clean if basic. The buffet food sub-par. The lounge looks unclean and tired and not worthy of first class.,lounge
558,The food is varied with hot Thai dishes fresh fruit sandwiches cakes and many drink options including fresh young coconut. The flight was delayed and though we were given a coupon for a meal in the terminal there was no need to use it with what was on offering the lounge. The wifi worked but the two computers with Thai keyboards in their business area did not. Friendly and efficient staff. Only complaint is that there is no toilet in the lounge.,lounge
559,Decent food and drink options but nothing spectacular. Comfortable and in a convenient location. The front desk staff does not have a computer connected to the reservations system so the poor attendant could not do anything besides check to see if we were legitimate to enter or not.,lounge
560,Not a fan. It was very crowded as I arrived for a late flight to Taipei. Hard backed chairs no couches or lounge chairs of any type. Very limited plugs to recharge electronics. There was a piece of paper taped to the beverage machine showing some complex code to get access to the wifi even when entered it didn't work luckily got on via the Air France lounge which must be close by. Limited beverage choices. Very bad food. Tiny albeit functional bathroom. If I had known how bad it was I would have stayed in the Delta lounge in the domestic terminal.,lounge
561,Excellent lounge from which BA could learn a great deal. Very comfortable seating with good views of the apron and runways and superb food. The food was fresh and delicious with a station cooking rice or noodle stir fry dishes to order. Maybe the best hot food in an airport lounge I have ever experienced.,lounge
562,I was allowed access as I had just travelled to Heathrow with BA in First. My excitement at being allowed into this hallowed space was short lived. It looked congested and untidy. The service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only. Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private. I moved to sit 'outside' on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic. After waiting 10 minutes for a coffee I quickly drank it and went to the First/Gold lounge which had a more comfortable and relaxing ambience.,lounge
563,Maybe it was the time I visited this lounge but there were so many passengers entering but not enough seats. After walking around for 10 minutes with my wife and daughter I was finally able to secure some seats. Granted the area around the seat had not been cleaned for a while which resulted in heaps of dirty plates and glasses. With seats secured I waited to see if anyone would clean up the plates/glasses. Someone did arrive 15 minutes later to clean it up. The lounge was chaotic around 1-30pm on a Saturday with way too many people and not enough seats. The noodle bar is always good but the sandwiches and other items were not as good. Good supply of drinks/ beverages. As another poster stated the lounge is really showing wear and tear. It is sad because this lounge and The Pier are the barometer for all other Cathay Pacific lounges. Another gripe I had was the elevator that connects the lounge to the departure gates way too small and slow. If I was in a rush I probably would have missed my flight despite it only being 7 minutes away at Gate 21. It may be better to grab a bite to eat outside and enjoy the spacious seats at the gates if the lounge continues to be way it was when I visited.,lounge
564,I little dated and old despite the newness of the Airport. Friendly welcoming staff not bad choice of drinks and food. None of the electric sockets worked where I was seated. Not too crowded. Internet and computers available for public use.,lounge
565,Friendly efficient staff compliment a large open plan lounge the looks out over the airport. There is a great little restaurant style noodle bar with a selection of Chinese food but watch out if you are looking for more western cuisine as it is lacking. So to is the selection of drinks which seems to have shrunk in recent years possibly due to cut backs. There is a large room with multiple PC terminals for good reliable internet surfing. Wi-Fi is free and up to par with speed and reliability. Restrooms and Shower cubicles are small and showing a little wear and tear as the years go by. However they are clean! Overall this is a great lounge but slowly starting to show some of its age.,lounge
566,China Airlines use the Alitalia lounge which give that Rome is their home base the lounge is poor. Why is it that airlines think that putting a lounge where there are no windows is good. Food and drink selection poor seating unimaginative toilets dirty.,lounge
567,Very basic seating. No view at all. Food very limited although the noodle bar was good. Shower rooms clean but too complicated. Plenty of computer and internet terminals. In the late evening when the North American and Australian flights are due to leave gets very busy with shortage of seats,lounge
568,I had just earned my Silver Executive Club membership and was looking forward to trying out a lounge on my own account without being a guest of one of my better traveled colleagues. Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned. To be fair to BA though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably don't have much influence over how its run. Just be prepared for disappointment if you're visiting this airport.,lounge
569,A very small and miserly stocked lounge. No hot food small selection of booze and no espresso.,lounge
570,The lounge was small compared to other Cathay lounges I have been at. There was the ever constant noodle bar serving up good food. They had two types of sandwiches (vegetarian and w/ meat) and they had cake + chinese dim sum. Good varieties of drinks including premium liquor and soft drinks. The lounge itself does not compare to the Wing or Pier lounges in HK but for Taipei it provides a nice oasis for travelers to eat and drink prior to their flight. It is a better alternative to the lacklustre duty free that is provided at Taoyuan airport. If there try the beef noodles in soup and not the spicy peanut sauce based noodles. There was free wifi and it was fast as well. Overall a very nice place to spend an hour or two before one's flight.,lounge
571,Haven't been to this lounge since before the renovations but what a difference. Great layout with a combination of lounge seating bar and workstations along the lines of other CX lounges and plenty of filtered light. Good food drink and reading material selections.,lounge
572,As a Diamond Frequent Flyer I enjoy this lounge quite regularly. And regularly experience the comfort excellent service wonderful showers fantastic staff great catering and the WOEFUL internet connection. Which drops out regularly. It seems three wireless services are available but they seem to drop out randomly without rhyme or reason. Even while typing this the connection failed twice. Not good enough Cathay Pacific.,lounge
573,Very nice little and quiet lounge right at the back of the terminal. Staff were very attentive. The food wasn't great and neither was the choice just a few sandwiches and biscuits to choose from. The wifi was fast and the lounge was clean. But there was a queue in front of the washrooms because there is pretty limited capacity.,lounge
574,An oasis of calm in what can be a busy terminal 3. Always plenty of seats with many overlooking the runway. It never seems busy here even though its used by American Airlines and now US Airways. An 8am departure - good choice of continental breakfast items. Everything you would expect from a lounge.,lounge
575,Have to say I was rather disappointed with this flagship lounge for Cathay. It seems to have a rather worn appearance the seats were quite tatty and dirty same for carpet areas and staff service was cold at very best. Nicest staff was the lady cleaning the shower rooms! Did not get to use the cabanas this time but found the shower-rooms rather cramped and dull for a first class facility in Asia. Had a snack in the dining room area and whilst it was quite good again I found the staff to be quite offhand and poor. Had problems with wifi but probably my fault and not that of the lounge service here.,lounge
576,Large lounge. Reasonably comfortable with ample seating some overlooking the aircraft apron. Many Internet stations in good working condition. Well-stocked with snacks and drinks including Dim Sum and wine. Good selection of magazines and newspapers. Two shower rooms and a few toilet cubicles all in sparkling condition. The lounge is not enclosed but sits open-air one level above the general departure area accessible by escalator and lift.,lounge
577,Not much has changed since my last visit to this lounge. Seats were old and dirty. Food selection was mediocre at best. The redeeming quality of this lounge is the attentiveness and willingness of the staff to help the guests.,lounge
578,The new lounge at Glasgow is a vast improvement on the old one very well laid out good selection of food and drinks. Staff on the desk very helpful and the lounge staff very attentive at both replenishing food/drinks as well as clearing used glasses etc away. Top tip sit in the whiskey snug hidden around the back and with no one in it. Only slight draw back is that it's not immediately at the gate but can live with that.,lounge
579,First time in this Lounge. Very disappointing 6pm food was curry chilli jacket potato with beans - really inspiring. Tables left dirty for over 15 minutes.,lounge
580,Lounge is ok but front desk staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. We were travelling with small children and needed a little extra assistance but no such luck. Highlights yet again vast difference in treatment between UK BA lounges and those stateside where your gold card often seems as welcome as tax bill.,lounge
581,"Nice lounge, spacious, clean and cool. Very nice lunch with plenty of choices of cooked food and sandwiches. No alcohol which is a pity because the food deserves a nice glass of red wine.",lounge
582,Cathay Pacific really underestimated the frequency of the shower room. It's always more than an hour waiting while I only have 2 hours transit time.,lounge
583,Furnishings and refreshments fine for the amount of custom but there were no showers available and the nearby toilets were out of use. The there computers available but the internet connection was extremely poor and very unreliable.,lounge
584,Food quality has gone down especially if you're looking for any protein. Breakfast before transatlantic flight was largely a selection of pastries and other unhealthy options. No cheese no eggs just lots of toast and low quality croissants. The food bar is not well maintained and everything reeks of cheapness and cost cutting from the biscuits and crisps to the wine selection. I asked for cheese and was rudely told there's none available before noon if then. The toilets are often smelly and not clean enough. There is often a queue to get in. It's a shame BA don't realize how this damages their brand. They've been cutting down on meals on board too of course but in the lounges it's really apparent. Hardly worth paying the extra fares; better to save the money and take your own high quality comestibles perhaps.,lounge
585,Pretty awful. No wifi or printers working. Food minimal and very drab. Quite crowded not much space. Toilets far away outside.,lounge
586,"The best word is ""rudimentary"".  Certainly not even close to anything offered by China Eastern Airlines  peers in Asia, or even airlines from North America.  The lounges were clean, and there was
food and some drinks, but poor. They're very basic in the seating department and rather plain.  Gin and warm tonic water were supplied, but no ice.  Wifi is impossible to connect-to unless one has a Chinese mobile telephone number.  There were no shower facilities available.  We went next-door to the First class lounge, it was pretty much the same as the business class lounge. China Eastern offer a comfortable, professional and pleasant inflight experience in business class.  The lounge experience doesn't even come close.",lounge
587,"Small crowded very 1974. On the bright side no blaring CNN or other stupid American TV ""news"" shows because you're in China! No monitor to check flight details. Announcements are made in sort of English but were so muffled and unintelligible to be useless. Very tired looking and in desperate need of a refit. Staff sort of want to help but don't really know how to.",lounge
588,What can I say this is so disgusting one would think that China Eastern could ensure that business travellers have a decent lounge at their flagship airport. Very poor wifi and no music or even CNN The lounge is dirty even the walls and chairs are falling apart how embarrassing for a nation that prides themselves on being ahead of the rest of the world clearly not in this arena.,lounge
589,Overall extremely disappointing. I used the lounge on a Saturday 10am - 1.30pm Large lounge with comfortable chairs and free wifi as you would expect little choice of newspapers no phone/tablet charging points. Coffee etc available choice of wines and spirits if you are hungry I suggest you eat beforehand! Hot food consists of toast. Cold food consists of fruit salad plain yoghurt in a large bowl (not single pots) ham and cheddar cheese plus pastries & biscuits. Heathrow has slightly more choice incl hot food.,lounge
590,The British Airways staff at T5 certainly didn't go to charm school. Awful choice of food ended up with a jacket potato lounge lacked character and looked dirty. Staff on the entrance uninterested and took no notice of me. The toilets in the business lounge were so dirty I changed my mind about taking a shower!,lounge
591,This is a domestic first (business) class lounge for China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines. Visited twice in the last 2 weeks and I'd say that this lounge is below average. No outside view of any kind. Boarding notifications shouted by staff. Stir fries and rice offered during meal time but not delicious and attractive at all. Some salad sandwiches dessert and other snacks available. Soft drinks plenty with some beer and wine. Used plates collected from time to time. Washrooms were clean. Biggest complaint is the wifi - uses public wifi which is extremely slow. Overall I only recommend because it has couches (more comfortable than the benches outside) and provides free drinks and edible food but don't come with high expectations.,lounge
592,Very poor lounge. Food is terrible chairs old dirty and uncomfortable. Staff unfriendly. Better to wait at boarding gate.,lounge
593,I had just become an Eastern Miles Golden Member but did not have the card with me yet. I asked the girl at the entrance of the lounge to let my 5-month pregnant wife to enter the lounge with me (something I was entitled to as Golden Member) also considering there were only 20 minutes left before boarding. The staff refused saying they wanted to see the card. I therefore entered the lounge alone: packed as usual (for Chinese it is extremely easy to join the lounge through their credit card membership) some average noodles sandwiches and fruit. I expressly asked the staff to let me know if the gate changed (it happens frequently in China) and they did not do that. Overall the standard terrible China Eastern's service.,lounge
594,Not made to feel especially welcome and when we were there at lunchtime there were not many places left to sit. Not crowded but very 'busy'. The hot food surprisingly for me and very strange for foreign visitors was pea soup! That was all - and some weird croutons. Uninspiring salad bar with no 'wow' factor whatsoever and three types of freshly-made sandwiches - ham and cheese chicken prawn with rose-marie sauce. All of them sorry to say utterly tasteless! The good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and Champagne (for that you have to ask an over-worked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting) Usual premium spirits selection with mixers. Toilets (men) were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly - not good enough! More like a traditional English pub on a Saturday night. Overall very underwhelmed with the whole experience and compared with other business class lounges at Heathrow and overseas in Middle East down at the bottom of the list - desperately needs upgrading to bring in line with competitors.,lounge
595,I visited this lounge on 24 May 2014. Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language. Luggage storage available. Toilet located outside lounge. Overall a pleasant (albeit not amazing) place to spend an hour before a flight.,lounge
596,For such a fantastic potential this remains a disappointing lounge. Wonderful views a very large area pretty good seating light and airy - all good. However: after over an hour in here we are getting the first sign of a cleaner; food is almost non existent (I mean this literally!) and the range and quality of drinks has declined over time. Inattentive staff the frustrating wifi system of getting scratchcards every 30 minutes and the paucity of refreshments leaves this well below bar. The long trek to T4S would be fine if we had something better when we arrived!,lounge
597,Although the food is decent in terms of quantity and quality the furniture is old and highly uncomfortable. Not many electric plug points for recharge etc. No announcements either.,lounge
598,Poor service of staff! Don't think it is their job to inform guests of delays (3 hours). Nobody cleans up after departed guests (or way too slowly). Food served is all packaged crackers and cling wrapped sandwiches. Chairs are old - seats in the public area of the terminal are more comfortable.,lounge
599,There are a few lounges located throughout the terminal with easy access to all gates. Attendants were very accommodating and explained the comforts of the lounge and that they would make a boarding call. Many hot appetizers as well as Asian / Western Dishes available. Well stocked bar as well as soft drinks water and tea. Assortment of Asian and English language newspapers. WIFI worked well and the 4 hours spent in the lounge were very pleasant.,lounge
600,Food non existent staff unhelpful totally unimpressed. Internet wireless not working correctly either. Can't wait to get on the plane and get out of this hole.,lounge
601,Both the north and south lounges in T5A are superb. Reception staff always friendly despite some miserable people who seem to complain a lot and should be kicked back to the public areas. The lounges are always busy but there are plenty of seats of many types. The showers are excellent staffed by such friendly ladies and whilst there is often a queue to use the toilets they are spotlessly clean. Good choice of food of sandwiches salads and hot items. The lentil and bean curry was spicy and excellent as was the Thai red curry. Two types of perfectly cooked rice or baked potato. Wide range of alcoholic drinks. The wifi is free easy to log on and of good enough speed despite many people using it. And a great view over airport. I always look forward to coming here.,lounge
602,Visited the Concorde Room on 2 May and used it for around ten hours. I stored my hand luggage with the attendant and proceeded to the dining area for breakfast. All food served in this lounge is waiter service and menus are scattered around the lounge for you to choose your selection from and change depending on the time of day. If you visit the First Galleries Lounge opposite the Concorde Room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the Concorde Room. There was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks. I booked one of the private cabanas when I organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed TV shower toilet free telephone use and room service. You can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours it's an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm. I also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service. I also used the Elemis Spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a First passenger. There is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork. My only criticism is that some of the soft furnishings are beginning to wear slightly.,lounge
603,Good lounge big and bright very clean I was there at breakfast and a variety of westernish and Chinese hot and cold dishes were available. Good fast wifi available and comfy chairs.,lounge
604,Lounge has been refurbished to include uncomfortable seating used to be a nice comfy lounge. Snacks and drinks not too bad. Not a place to spend 6 hours (any more).,lounge
605,Small lounge close to gate 46 at terminal 2 with portable wall surrounds to divide from the rest of the waiting area quite noisy because of the walls and also very busy as were all other lounges. Simple snacks and drinks available plus cold Tsingdao beer and red wine. Not bad for a domestic lounge.,lounge
606,Smallish lounge shared by several airlines. Very pleasant staff and free bar for BA customers. Excellent showers mediocre food offerings. Other airline users pay for alcoholic beverages.,lounge
607,Rome Fiumicino Arrivals Terminal is a nightmare but International Departures Terminal Four is state of the art. Even on the busiest weekend of the year—canonization of John Paul II and John XIII—the space was remarkably civilized. The terminal raised expectations for the executive lounge. We were flying Turkish Airlines - in Rome they use British Airways executive lounge. The lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it. Apart from a series of good abstract prints and a series of photographs of architectural details of Rome the space is clinical. Solid blocks of rectilinear grey-beige vinyl sofas and matching chairs suggest that travelers necessarily move in groups of ten -–the squares are intimidating for parties of one or two but once these islands are occupied even by a single traveler they become impenetrable by others. One side of the space is plate glass blindingly bright so only half of the seating cells can be comfortably occupied. Especially for travellers suffering from jet lag the initial unsettling affect of the anti-intimate seating and hyper lighting is subtly exacerbated of other details of the ambiance. The floor carpeted in a non-descript blue felt-like substance is not as might be expected flat. Rather it rises and falls in just such a way as to make you stumble. Internet connection is available but requires an inordinately complex set of interventions to access. Once acquired it is difficult to find one of the few plugs that is not already being used by another harried voyager. The culinary experience like the digital environment is disconcerting. We were arrived at 1 p.. lunchtime. Cereal and yogurt was on offer as well as croissants and cookies. Breakfast apparently lasts all day at the BA lounge. There was a self-serve bar which included red and white wine. The red came in a Bordeaux bottle but it tasted like it had been decanted from a box. Our empty glasses stayed with us during the entirety of our wait.,lounge
608,Absolutely shocking. Stale and tasteless lumps of bread. Food in fact that I would be more likely to throw out. Disinterested staff. Without doubt with regards to the food on offer this was the worst I'd ever been to. Nothing to do with British Airways incidentally. We were given access by means other than our airline tickets.,lounge
609,Pretty good lounge PVG has lounges located at most international gate ares so not overcrowded. Good selection of hot food and snacks when I was there around 6pm and good bar variety too. Wifi worked well and English papers and magazines available too.,lounge
610,More than adequate lounge separate from business class. Hostess helpful and friendly. Electrical outlets for last minute computer/ pda charging are abundant. Nice selection of hot/ cold food both western and Asian; as well as alcohol sodas and water. I would like to see more Western magazines and newspapers other than the LA Times but that would be the only minor criticism.,lounge
611,In general this lounge was an average one to all the ones I been to. This lounge was also empty. They had a bad section of food but it tasted okay. The lounge felt and looked boring. The lounge had no internet but it had power points. The bathrooms were good but lacked showers. The staff were friendly.,lounge
612,For a small airport this lounge was excellent. It was elegant clean and had a respectable selection of food and beverage.,lounge
613,The worst business lounge I've ever seen. There is little food available; what there was consisted of a few different small cakes (I think) packaged snacks and mixed nuts. There is a reasonable selection of drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic but the ice was in an open ice bucket and mostly melted; dried-up slices of lemon on a plate. There is no separate bathroom; you have to use the general public ones outside the lounge. The decor is a particularly unpleasant shade of pale purple. All in all it's a most unwelcoming prospect.,lounge
614,At OSL BA uses the OSL lounge (owned by airport authorities). I often take the late BA flight to LHR after work. If hungry eat somewhere else - food and beverages are below standard for BA lounges. Decent selection of newspapers. Best feature: The lounge is wonderfully quiet. So worth visiting after long day at work to wind down before the flight. Very comfortable chairs and sofas (though not particularly modern or elegant) and a quiet atmosphere. I like it. About 10 mins walk to BA gates from lounge.,lounge
615,The quality of the food is dropping every time I spend some times in this lounge. Chilli con carne without proper rice ice cream fridge empty quality of wine getting lower and lower. I also found surprising that nothing is done in the last year to fix some power sockets that do not work (next to seat or on the PC table). It seems that BA believe that quality of service is not important for the price of ticket you have to pay. Maybe they will have a wake-up call like Lufthansa when people will fly different airlines.,lounge
616,I think the standard has gone downhill. It's not as clean as before. The wine is mediocre. No bread or nice cheese. The coffee beans are not the same. No more nice different cookies just a pot with a cookie that's has the taste of nothing. I was happy to pay the price for Club to be able to get in. But as for now no way.,lounge
617,"Well below expectation for a First/Business class lounge. Poor food and beverage choice and very limited options for an international traveller. China Southern Airlines Staff at lounge desk do not communicate at all. Poor communication and very, very limited English spoken. Unable to communicate when there are delays or changes. Very poor announcements made. Speaker was broken and sitting behind a cabinet so added to the poor English, unable to hear what was being said. Could not connect to Wifi - staff unhelpful, unwilling to assist. Due to 4 hour delay in flight this was a very painful experience to be stuck here for 4 hours !",lounge
618,Plenty of light snacks of crisps flapjacks brownies biscuits and soup. The choice of drinks was impressive choice of wines beers and spirits. The lounge ambience was not the best but very functional. Something to note if you arrive early the check in desks may not be open until a couple of hours before departure and the self service machines will no longer be available.,lounge
619,You need to have the One World Gold card to access this lounge if you're travelling business class. Lounge offers space; comfortable seating great showers and washrooms and a spa with a very good massage for free (but most often fully booked). A great buffet with a wide choice (chilli con carne one of the best I've ever had) with a number of dishes you can order from the waiters. A huge wine selection of very good wines and vintage champagnes.,lounge
620,Spotlessly clean relaxing and fantastic views of airside and runway. Service by staff very friendly and welcoming. There is storage for your luggage if you want to dump everything and relax or walkabout (though Newark airport has few shops/duty-free). Lounge only has 1 shower. The food really was amazing. Worth getting to the airport early enough to eat.,lounge
621,"Our transit stop of 7 hours turned into 9 due to aircraft delays. The lounge is on 2 levels with main eating downstairs and more limited offerings upstairs. The food for evening meal was mainly Asian style but most westerners would find something of their liking. There is not much of a variety of wine and alcohol but plenty of juice, soft drink and tea/coffee. Showers are available but you need to book at lounge reception. The lounge is reasonably comfortable and there is a free massage chair. There was one newspaper printed in English.",lounge
622,Used twice tired lounge with electric sockets rather tired (upstairs the seat lighting kept not working as plugs fell out). Showers good but have seen wear. Massage chairs good. A lot of cleaners with minimal English and one or two higher staff who have okay english.,lounge
623,In a very basic cold airport this lounge was just okay. As its not very busy there seemed to be enough seating and is fairly comfortable. Staff are tolerant of us but not endearing. The food was fine if you didn't want anything European and there was no alcohol to speak off other than a white red and Kirrin Beer. The classic is that they have a closed smoking room that everyone was using. Each time we left the lounge to stretch our legs we were challenged on our return to show that we were entitled to be there. Just like China Southern their lounge is okay if you can get your head around the fact that its a Chinese airline not a European one!,lounge
624,Very spacious and great views. We experienced breakfast and lunch which were adequate but not as good as the Heathrow T5 lounge. The hot food was too limited. Porridge and soup offerings were tasty and nice champagne.,lounge
625,Use this lounge 2-3 times a month and position is okay subject to which A gates you board from. It is cramped not just at peak times and BA seem to have become complacent about improving this. Toilets can be very risky unless you catch at the moment they have just been cleaned and often filthy and unpleasant. Food is at Travelodge level (UK travellers will know what I mean) and fails to match standards at some better European airline lounges. Staff at reception only want to see a card or boarding pass and I think these must be the ones that didn't make the grade at charm school. Don't get me wrong I like BA but their lounge standards (including First) here at Terminal 5 are now poor.,lounge
626,I appreciate this lounge is never going to be empty but I always find the lounge too busy to be comfortable. On my last visit just before New Year cups and glasses took a relative age to be removed and the food choices seemed less than usual along with having to queue to use the toilet. I've had decent stays in this lounge but the last two visits haven't been relaxing or pleasurable. It's got to the point where I've ended up at the Espresso cafe at the very end of the southern part of T5.,lounge
627,The lounge is spacious - about 30-40 seats. The sofas are comfortable and the room is clean. A refrigerator is stocked with 8-10 different types of beverages. The food is more a brunch style with several Chinese style breakfast items and a few western style lunch options. I was not hungry that day and I only tried the breakfast porridge and dessert cake. They were both good. The internet is fast with good signal strength.,lounge
628,Quite basic no frills. Breakfast is poor staff are not friendly. Seats are ok if I had to spend a long time in this Lounge I would not be happy.,lounge
629,It's peaceful spacious good airport view. Friendly and courteous staff escort you from entry had a nice snack dinner took a 30 minute nap and attendant woke me for boarding.,lounge
630,BA use the JAL Sakura Business Lounge at NRT. Spacious clean and a separate dining area if one wanted to eat. Decent tarmac views. Nice lounge and a pleasant way to spend an hour or so.,lounge
631,Disappointing and poor quality. From the challenge in finding the lounge to the surly receptionist to the very poor range of snacks this was a real disappointment. I was flying British Airways and it is to be hoped that they will try to persuade the airport to improve this lounge. Small in size basic in furnishings poorly lit. One bottle of wine only in the whole lounge and a choice of one type of beer. Snacks with very little choice and poor quality. Lavatories were outside of the lounge. Unhelpful staff.,lounge
632,Much improve. They have enlarged the lounge and offer a reasonable range of snacks sandwiches and drinks. The beer/wine is fine and the snacks of a good quality. Friendly staff and excellently located. Clean well maintained. I suspect they will need to upgrade it more for the 2018 World Cup as it is relatively basic by some standards but is none the less safe quiet clean and friendly. I have been to this lounge many times -it does its job.,lounge
633,My visit was from 1900-2200hrs. At that time it was not crowded and the service level by staff and the food was excellent. Quick tip - On arrival at the lounge book the Clairol 15 minute massage or facial this is free. All in all a very good experience.,lounge
634,I and my husband travelled from LA to Tokyo via Guangzhou on last week. Their lounge is one of the best lounge we have been in. The staff were very helpful. We could spent a good time in classy place.,lounge
635,Beijing-Brisbane via Guangzhou in C class. It looks really amazing very comfortable both upstairs and downstairs. I also had a shower It was the best shower room at airline lounge. Boarding information behind mirror - wow really impressive. But the service at this lounge is just not up the standard. Staff cold and not helpful particular the chef. He was rude and unhelpful I ordered some dumplings on the menu but until my flight start boarding I did not see dumpling anywhere. All in all great facility but unacceptable service.,lounge
636,I am a gold member with BA. On 28th December I was flying to Tampa with my wife and three youngsters that we care for access to the lounge was denied which I accepted but not having seen the notice not to remove refreshments when I took three small soft drinks and three packets of crisps out to the children I was virtually attacked on my return with a BA staff member waving his finger at me stating it was a massive No no for me to do this. I was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what I thought to be a small crime! The staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills I would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level. On our quick exit I did point out to him that I had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored. BA have responded to my complaint stating that they have passed my concerns onto the LGW management team.,lounge
637,Busy lounge in T5A South before New Year. Very dark and uninviting. Limited viewing area most of the seats face inward the building. Very limited choice of food - few sandwich one soup and some cakes. Good selection of wines but depends on where you sit. Good wifi. Service was very slow (not attentive) and the receptionists weren't welcoming. A very disappointing lounge.,lounge
638,Terrace Lounge in Aberdeen has just been renovated. Friendly staff spacious seating/working area and good selection of soft drink also one red/white wine on offer. Food is limited to sandwich and cakes but that's sufficient for a regional airport.,lounge
639,Fantastic lounge good food reasonable selection of drinks friendly staff and so comfortable. They even a have large screen TV with one area set out like a cinema for those long stays and they staff are always on hand to find you a movie in English or Chinese. Could not complain about anything.,lounge
640,Nothing to write home about. No windows for viewing limited choice of food (packed crackers etc.) and drinks (instant coffee). Recently enlarged to create more space and seats making it a bit more comfortable but in peak hours still busy. This is also due to airport or airline staff using it to invite friends in. Also no wifi available just some PC's for general use (mostly occupied). No showers I have noticed. Staff can be attentive (depending on individual style) but English remains an issue with most of them. There is a first class lounge 50 meters away but it never seems to be open when I am around for catching early morning flights (9 am)? Compared with the domestic lounge at the same airport the international lounge is not up to the standard.,lounge
641,This new lounge opened just a week ago. It is absolutely appalling. There is no food All the trays are empty. Juice dispensers are empty. Coffee machines don't work. Only a few packets of cheap biscuits in a basket. When I asked the staff (who was rude and unhelpful) if the trays and juice dispensers would be refilled the answer was no and he walked away. This was 10am. The lounge looks pleasant and comfortable enough. In the end orange juice was made available but we would have to approach the staff to ask for it. WIFI is not free.,lounge
642,Not an experience I will repeat  poor service very slow which in hindsight was a blessing given the quality of the food when it finally arrived. To see how a lounge should be run fly Qatar Airways.,lounge
643,This might not have the 'wow factor' of Terminal 5 lounges it is very good. A fairly long trek to get there but efficient friendly professional more spacious than you first think. Good internet excellent range of wines. Food is good quality though a little lacking in variety and with tiny plates! Good variety of seating and very pleasant environment. You can work relax sleep or whatever you need to here. Clearing up service seems a little under staffed as used plates and glasses can take a long time to be collected - but BA would benefit from more staff on this duty the ones who are there are good.,lounge
644,bustle of the main terminal. Very efficient staff clearing away welcoming reception staff. Breakfast food is excellent. Wide selection of excellent wines and other drinks. Good internet and very clear information boards. It does get busy of course but manages this well. Clean bathrooms.,lounge
645,Very good overall. I have visited this lounge a number of times - the variety of food can be a little inconsistent at times but the quality is good with a good mix of cold and warm snacks salads etc. Good range of drinks and nice selection of wine - though it is a pity that the Cava has seemingly been withdrawn! Comfortable large bright with natural light and excellent view of the runway - huge glass front the lounge which extends along its whole length. Reception is friendly and professional. Wifi system is frustrating - you have to collect scratchcards from reception which only last 30 minutes - seems unnecessary. Its a little bit of a challenge to find the lounge but well worth when you do.,lounge
646,FCO-LGW I entered the lounge after a long a hot journey to the airport. The lounge was quiet and it was being shared by the other one world airlines. There was no hot or cold food there were only crisps. There were plenty of drink options. I was very disappointed as British Airways have a few flights out of Rome to London Heathrow London Gatwick and London City.,lounge
647,Surprisingly poor. The pre-flight buffet was unappetizing. I found nothing I wanted to eat and the staffer on the door to that section (keeping away other airline's passengers) was unfriendly to the point of rudeness. The main lounge is horribly lit. You have to find someone if you want a glass of Champagne and there are not that many staff around. It is so different from Virgin's lounge at JFK I'm just confused. By contrast the BA lounge at City Airport in London is fine.,lounge
648,The BA all-business service to JFK was a fine flight. The lounge at City is surprisingly good for a fairly small space. The snacks and drinks were fine and staff serving was friendly and efficient. (The hike to the washrooms is tiresome.),lounge
649,I received complimentary use of this lounge when I took an Iberia flight that connected in NY. I heard that BA has great lounges so I was looking forward to it. It was a letdown to say the least. I was greeted to 3 stale inch-wide sandwich slivers on a tray set off to the side. Bottles of water had not been replenished. I was starving and asked they would be replenishing food/drinks etc. I was told that everything would arrive around 6 - when I asked this question it was about 2 pm. It was also extremely hot in the lounge; hot to the point where certainly something must have been wrong with their air systems. Pay for use of this lounge? Not a chance. In fact you'd have to pay me.,lounge
650,Found the room to be spacious and spread out - tables seemed full and walked around to find open spots at a community table. Food well laid out and offered variety of breakfast items (hot and cold) with juice beverages and coffee available. Staff helpful. No flight announcements so had to watch the board. Wifi as well as a couple of computers to use.,lounge
651,British Airways Galleries First lounge at JNB is the worst airport lounge I have visited. BA should be absolutely ashamed to call this a lounge much less a first class lounge. Slow unusable internet poor or non-existent service. Lousy food which is identical to the adjoining business lounge Champagne sitting in lukewarm water with no ice for 2 hours.,lounge
652,Easy to find but very uncomfortable to sit in. Choose between massive armchairs that are far too big or sit at the small tables that are used for eating on rock hard dining chairs. Good range of drinks on offer but limited snacks. Only 15 minutes Wifi free any more you pay for.,lounge
653,Busy but not over-full. I arrived for some lunch snacks before 1455 Marrakech departure. I'm vegetarian so it would be appreciated if the sandwiches could be labelled. Plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side. Alcoholic drinks available on a self-service basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it (I saw it being carried out to people). The big drawback about this lounge is that it doesn't have enough power points. The only ones I could find were situated next to seats right round the L shaped lounge to the left. Also it's not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in. Loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entry/exit. Signs? The coffee is still excellent from the machine - why it's so foul onboard Club Europe is anyone's guess. My only other moan is that unless you're a frequent flyer from LGW it's not clear how far the gate is from the lounge. No map on the mobile app nor anything in the Highlife magazine. Gate 54 appeared and I wasn't sure if I had to walk all the way over that irritating airbridge which adds another 10 minutes to your journey.,lounge
654,Appalling lounge. Probably the one of the worst Business Class lounge I have used. ignorant staff at the entrance desk to the lounge. Plus points - a big lounge? The food was crisps or cheese and crackers. That’s it. I did use the showers and although the shower room was big it could have done with modernising. There is no self service drinks area only a staffed bar which was a typical American type bar with all the seats taken and no room to place an order. Had to lift the drinks over peoples heads. Again the bar staff were quite rude and surly and God help you if you order more than 2 drinks! This airport falls way way below any decent European airport. After a great holiday in New York this airport really did let the city down.,lounge
655,A substandard lounge. Most importantly for me the lounge only provides access to the Free Terminal Internet rather than a dedicated service. This service does not allow access to corporate networks so I could not synchronize my email before the flight. Further the service was so slow I could not even access my personal Gmail. I left my hotel this morning anticipating that I would pick up breakfast in the lounge. The breakfast options were Crisps and a dry biscuit bread - below expectation and below the competitive benchmark. The only newspapers available were a Jewish / Israeli weekly in English and only other Hebrew and Middle Eastern publications. Nothing in English German or Dutch. It was peak hour yet half the lounge was closed off creating a shortage of seating. For tea there was no milk available just powdered creamer. There was one hot food facility available. it was empty and appeared to be out of use. The general conditions and atmosphere in the Lounge were far below the pre flight experience offered by competitors.,lounge
656,Spacious clean and quiet this lounge offered the standard beverage selection by American standards (ie. the worst in the developed world) and some decent snacks on offer. Along with bagels and bread that you can toast yourself with spreads there were also various other nibbles available. Free wifi and newspapers but no flight announcements. It was a good experience overall but it was after I had to endure a couple of United Red Carpet Clubs on the trip!,lounge
657,This lounge has a very limited range of food and drink but this would be just about acceptable if there was somewhere to escape the relentless sax led funk background music. Dreadful.,lounge
658,We had a two hour wait in the lounge and found it to be very comfortable and the complimentary hot and cold food was excellent. There was a complimentary bar as well. Free Wi-Fi and special areas for viewing TV programs and also working areas with desktop computers.,lounge
659,Much improved from my last visit 3 years ago. WiFi is available the bathrooms are in the lounge. It is air conditioned. It is bigger. Good selection of drinks although you have to ask the desk to replenish. Snacks only. Very good for a regional airport.,lounge
660,Twice have had to fight to get in despite having a clear reservation paid for by my company. Eventually they begrudgingly let me in. The way they speak to people is loud and embarrassing it really is time Continental taught these desk staff that customer service should not be discourteous or humiliating. Lounge was scruffy and with unhelpful staff. The only food was little packs of crackers and cheese and apples. Hot drinks available but soft drinks had to be collected at the bar. As I was on a long haul international flight I expected that a better selection of food would be available. cI have not bothered with the lounge since prefering the airport shops and restaurants.,lounge
661,Spacious lounge but very overcrowded when I used it. Lounge chairs were comfortable but it was a mission to find an empty one. No problems in terms of cleanliness; a little messy because of all the users but had clean carpets and chairs. Food choices were very disappointing for a business class lounge - probably the worst I have ever seen! Good wi-fi connection and nice work stations. Didn't look at the showers but option was available. Staff service mediocre - didn't seem enthusiastic or lively about their job at all.,lounge
662,The lounge in Sao Paulo is a welcomed retreat from the rest of this very hectic airport. It has plenty of seating and is clean the wifi can be hit/miss but generally is acceptable. They could use a few more televisions as they only have 1 but just being out of the main terminal is a great benefit. They provide finger food soup bread and cheese nothing really spectacular but as mentioned better than the rest of the terminal.,lounge
663,The last time I visited the LGW BA Terraces lounge it was on two floors - now there is only one. Entry was fast and there is a good selection of food and drinks on offer. It was about midday and there was a full and extensive salad buffet with cold cuts. There was also a selection of sandwiches. The wide drinks selection is there. But the sheer volume of passengers makes it like a January sale. BA has removed a number of flights from Gatwick and moved them to Heathrow and halved the floor space of its lounge as a result. However the remaining floor space isn't enough for the flights still operating from Gatwick. So expect crowds empty food trays no drink glasses and occupied showers. Rest assured that the sandwiches will never be stale - they are never available long enough to get that way.,lounge
664,"Superb level of service - attentive and friendly without being ""over the top"". Excellent range of wine and other drinks. Very good food. Calm and relaxed atmosphere. Excellent washroom facilities.",lounge
665,Much better than the North Lounge. Ample breakfast food. Comfortable and serene. Recommended.,lounge
666,My wife and I were flying Newark to Orlando in First Class and are both Continental OnePass Gold Elite card holders. We were refused access to the lounge because Gold cards only grant access on international routes. Refusal was quite abrupt so I asked to speak to a supervisor. He explained Continentals' lounge policy and apologised for it's complexity. He went on to ask if I had any other Star Alliance cards - a Diamond Club Gold card holder was sufficient to gain access - another airline's card is more beneficial than Continental's. The lounge is very big bright and nicely furnished with superb view of the apron. Not a huge range of food or beverages but complimentary wi-fi. Showers and restrooms in the lounge. A relaxing place to while away time but be sure to do the homework before arriving at the desk.,lounge
667,Spacious with good light and decent reading material but minimal and cheesy food offerings. Unfortunately the staff tend to be rude and unhelpful. They never want to let me in even though I always qualify for entry with my elite status. This treatment defeats the purpose of holding elite status and being recognized as a valued customer. After arguing for entry I always have high expectations for the place and it never seems to live up. If it's crowded inside you'd probably be better off walking around Terminal C and shopping or people- watching.,lounge
668,Large lounge in terminal E that is new and generally has lots of room. I have been there in the mornings and it can be packed. This time was midday for a flight to Mexico about half full and plenty of space. It has nice views of the gates and taxi ways has showers (I have not used them) open bar that is staffed and snacks.,lounge
669,Decent food on offer cheese cakes a curry mushroom soup and some thai titbits that were very tasty. Reasonable wine choice mainly Australian including sparkling wine rather than champagne. Staff were very efficient at clearing plates. There appeared to be plenty of showers although I didn't need to use them. The only negative was painfully slow WiFi I gave up trying. I also tried to JAL lounge it was more spacious but BA had better drink and marginally better food.,lounge
670,Ridiculously busy dirty and poor food. How did BA ever sink so much? The North lounge at Heathrow is now beyond the pale and the south lounge is not much better. It is not a pleasant experience and compares unfavourably to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow by some distance. It's hard to find any privacy in these lounges. The food at best is of average quality and I am unsurprised to read that the Food Standards Agency has ordered improvements in basic hygiene levels in these lounges. I'm afraid I too myself off to the Eat cafe for coffee. I felt the £1.75 I paid there was better value and certainly the coffee was better. Shame on you BA. For the prices you charge you should treat your Club class passengers with more respect.,lounge
671,I have used this lounge many times and it is the best compared to other Continental lounges. Good seating showers and work centers. Snacks are light but all right. Drinks are free which is nice. All in all a good lounge.,lounge
672,Despite flying 1st class on a trip around the world ticket I was initially denied access. Paid 50$ to get in. Domestic flight passengers are excluded only members of Continental FF. Though Internet facilities are available no computers are available. Food nothing to write home about. The lounge is spacious.,lounge
673,This is the worst lounge that I have been in. Breakfast only sweet biscuits sweet croissants some sandwiches - early in the morning and once the food is gone it is gone. So do yourself a favour and do not come to the Le Anfore lounge as it is not worth the trouble. I would hate to think what they charged Qantas for the orange juice and the coffee we had.,lounge
674,"Overall a disappointment even with a discount. Because time blocks are sold based upon your departure time we were obliged to ""buy"" 3-hours of access when we only needed two. On the plus side the lounge is calm airy comfortable and has great views of the tarmac. On the other hand staff were indifferent and insufficiently aware of the needs of the ""buffet"" station. The food itself was barely okay. Selection and quality were narrow. The ""hot"" dishes most certainly were not and I worried about that. Wine selection was also okay. House selection(s) were Canadian brands. Was it worth $85CAD+? No.",lounge
675,Poor wifi lazy staff and pokey lounge. Front desk ran out of buffet tickets for business class diners and just generally feels badly organized. I did a speed test on the wi-fi and it was <1 mb/s. lounge is shared with AA but really can't accommodate many people at all. Some nice armchairs in first area but otherwise cramped and uncomfortable. I fly out out here often and it's just not good enough for BA.,lounge
676,I have been in this lounge before when I used mileage to upgrade to Business class. The lounge is spacious with plenty of drinks but not much food offered except cheese crackers and chips. It has free internet connection. This trip I got an Elite upgrade and thought I could use the lounge. Yes I could but my spouse who also was an Elite passenger waiting for an upgrade was not allowed to accompany me. A rude receptionist insisted that it was Continental Airlines policy concerning passengers flying to Caribbean and South America! I placed a call to Continental One Pass to find down if that was really the case and got no coherent answer. Two hours later my spouse got upgraded but it was too late to go in the place!,lounge
677,"This is a small but comfortable lounge that has good views of the ramp and aircraft departing. Snack choices limited and food purchased out in the concourse is not allowed. Probably the best feature is the bar as the complimentary Bloody Marys are excellent and service is great. Premium wine is also available for purchase although the prices can be steep. On this visit we noted that ""Opus One"" super premium red wine was $39.00 a glass! Due to its size the lounge can get a bit crowded at times; however as Continental only offers nonstop flights from LAX to New York/Newark Houston Honolulu and Cleveland this is usually not a problem.",lounge
678,"How pathetic! True embarassment for Continental - no real food $9 ""premium"" drinks and sloppy and disaffected help. Really an incredibly poor lounge in this ""flagship"" terminal C at Newark. You will be better off just walking about the terminal and visiting shops.",lounge
679,I visited this lounge at the end of a wonderful trip to the Niagara Falls area for a family reunion flying in and out of Toronto from London. Part of the enjoyment was travelling in business class (Club World) and on the return trip I had several hours to enjoy the Lounge before the night flight. What made it special for me was the very kind and attentive manager Tony (I don't have his surname). And it wasn't just Tony as all the staff were very nice and welcoming. They are good ambassadors for BA!,lounge
680,Thought we'd try the lounge as it was yards away from departure gate. What a pleasant surprise. Quiet and peaceful and away from the crowds in the mail lounge. I think it's even better than First!,lounge
681,I found this lounge great for relaxing and unwinding as only British Airways first class passengers are allowed in. Unless you have your 5000 frequent flier tier points to get a Concorde Room Card all gold and silver card holders use the galleries lounges meaning this one is much more quiet and peaceful. Staff did a good job keeping the lounge clean but sometimes this meant that they took a bit too much time to fulfill passenger's requests. Although they definetly did not outdo themselves in terms of the restroom/shower quality they did a good job with it and I found each well kept. Business center had pretty fast Internet and wifi worked well. Although the food options offered were all very tasty one thing I disliked about this lounge was that those options were pretty limited and other than a few main course choices there were only light snacks available upon request. Overall I think Britsh Airways took a good risk by not making this lounge extremely large and instea d putting their focus on the quality of the area and I would definetly visit again and recommend it to others.,lounge
682,"The ""Official"" Continental lounge in Newark was very disappointing on the outbound - so it was with some misgivings that we rested up in their shared lounge in Lima Peru. We need not have worried - it was bordering on very good. Free drinks including spirits reasonable selection of tasty snacks and food decent well spaced seats TVs and business center. The only annoying factor was a lounge representative yelling (literally!) from the center of the floor in annoying Spanish - flight details and boarding information. Overall though a good experience.",lounge
683,This was my first time visiting this Lounge. This will probably be my last. I have experienced other airline/airport lounges before and this one is disappointing. I bought a day pass ($45) and decide to see whether it is really worth it. The lounge is circular and very spacious. However there is only 1 snack bar in the entire lounge. Therefore if you were sitting on the other side of the lounge you had to get up and walk all the way around to get to the snack bar.,lounge
684,The only downside to this lounge is that it doesn't open until 4pm for the evening flights (I am not sure if it is open in the morning for the morning flight out of JFK) so if you have a long layover chances are you will have to spend some time in the Galleries First and Terraces Lounges which are nice but don't touch the quality of this lounge. A very tranquil and peaceful area British Airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc. there are also staff available to help with anything you need. When dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter. The wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax. The only negative to this lounge is that the spa/shower rooms are not in the Lou ge so to take a shower I had to walk across the terminal and into the Business class lounge but it's a small terminal so it's not that bad. Overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and I actually prefer it over the Concorde room at London Heathrow.,lounge
685,The aesthetics of the lounge are very pleasing the food and service levels are dismal. Food is served under hot lamps but unfortunately they don't do their work food is cold. Attempting to speak to staff made no difference. British Airways are expensive customers who part with well earned cash deserve an above average experience. This wasn't average it was dismal.,lounge
686,Very poor. The quality and choice of the food has gone downhill. They must be on an economy drive or changed supplier as the difference has been very noticeable. BA are falling behind in the premium class. I'm writing this in the lounge on the world's slowest Internet connection too!,lounge
687,Holideck lounge is three level lounge shared by many airlines. It is operated by KLM and is located past security in Terminal 4. The lounge covers three levels and has good views of the runway and taxiway. There are no washrooms or showers in the lounge and limited internet facilities. There are two bars both of which were unattended. Passengers just went behind the bar and helped themselves to a drink. Snacks were limited to chips packaged cheese and some cookies. Very basic and low in quality. The only plus side is the ability to escape the turmoil of Heathrow and have a peaceful drink.,lounge
688,"Tocumen Airport in Panama is not particularly large, but it sprawls out over a good distance. The Copa Club is centrally located, but it is very difficult to find. The entrance is relatively small and nondescript. There is no signage to help confused passengers, and the directions given by airport employees only made matters worse. I am a retired Spanish teacher, so this wasn't a language problem. A few well-placed signs would solve this problem easily. Once the club is found, it becomes obvious that their template for airport lounges comes from the United Club. The food and drink choices are a mirror image of United's with one exception - quality alcoholic beverages are free. I would recommend the airline but not the lounge.",lounge
689,Comfortable and attractive enough but a rather crowded lounge which is difficult to locate. Ground staff are not very helpful and lounge staff not very welcoming. Very little food and limited drinks available. Not a bad place but these and other customer service issues as well as limited facilities and food make this a very basic lounge that will not be remembered well by any visitor. No one would look forward to a second visit.,lounge
690,First time flying in First through T5 and huge disappointment with the Concorde Lounge - no dedicated security checks means you stand in a queue for 30 minutes. Lounge is small and cramped - staff poorly trained and clearly have no natural customer service flair. Restaurant booths were full when we were there - staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space (in the end we went to the Gordon Ramsey opposite the lounge). Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business. Overall don't use this lounge and T5 as any kind of reason to fly British Airways!,lounge
691,Having visited the BA First lounges at JFK and LGW and being disappointed I was very surprised how good the lounge was. Lots of space and natural light and good food and drink choice. The Mrs and I had made to order food as well as helping ourselves to the hot buffet and cakes we felt very spoilt. Nice champagne only let down was the Johnny Walker Blue available at LGW was missing.,lounge
692,"31 May 2013 afternoon and evening usage due to a long layover. The lounge space is quite nice and functions reasonably well despite lacking shower facilities. The glass tube shaped terminal building offers nice tarmac views from this lounge. The food service is merely average most of the day but the beverage service is quite good. A dinner buffet was served much too late for the ""Sleeper Service"" flight. BA does this to exclude the CX customers who share the lounge but it gives BA passengers only about an hour prior to boarding leaving very little time for flexibility. Lounge front counter staff members were outstanding and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Overall one of the nicer BA lounges though not quite as well equipped as their lounges at LHR T5.",lounge
693,Very small lounge for the size of airport and became very busy toward departure time of mid afternoon flight. Very attentive reception staff. Food on offer at approximately 1400 hrs was fine (sandwich selection pastries soup biscuits crisps nuts etc). Lounge staff cleared and cleaned up efficiently. This lounge just needs to be extended as it is too small. Close to gates 10 +11 for the LHR flights and boarding calls made timely.,lounge
694,Good welcome. Despite being busy plenty of seating - either for sitting at table to eat or just sitting. Great selection of food which was frequently refreshed. Clear up service of used plates and mugs somewhat slow. Great viewing of planes landing. Toilet facilities clean and sufficient.,lounge
695,Very disappointed in the Concorde Room. The dining staff seemed almost irritated that we wanted breakfast. Scrambled eggs were cold. I'm still waiting for the second cup of coffee I requested. Very pleasant seating outside in the terrace area but so difficult to catch the attention of the staff. I eventually went up to the bar myself but the one guy was busy filling orders for the waitresses and I had to wait to catch his attention. I saw no food except for the food served in the dining area. Next time we will go to the Galleries Lounge and help ourselves.,lounge
696,The BA lounge at Warsaw airport is located after Immigration control on the lower level. A fairly quiet lounge with hot and cold drinks available but a poor selection of snacks. Crisps and nuts seem to make up BA's choice of food in Warsaw although a few stale bread rolls were available with cheese. The lounge offers a basic product.,lounge
697,Late morning flight to Heathrow. I found the lounge relatively easily. Warm welcome limited flight information in the lounge but flight was called in plenty of time (40 minutes prior) and boarding had only just started when we arrived. Travelling to the gate (G12) involved using a shuttle/train so it is worth giving yourself plenty of time. Lounge very spacious. Newspapers available but no English language magazines. Food limited but - too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. Catering consisted of crisps nuts fruit and a few pastries. Coffee machine broken. Beer on tap but another passenger commented that the barrel needed to be changed. Plenty of alcohol available including prosecco. Luggage storage space available. Toilets decent and within lounge.,lounge
698,Mid morning flight to Rome a reasonably warm welcome at the front desk. Decent selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge was very busy and it was a struggle to find 2 seats in particular ones surrounded by used glasses plates and cups. Wi-fi was difficult to connect to although more the fault of myself and my iPad. Password readily displayed and there is a a guide in the lounge for iPad users. Champagne available on request and (unusually) freely available in the bar area. Selection of basic breakfast items juices and snacks. There is very limited hot food available in this lounge. Toilets very clean.,lounge
699,"We had some difficulty finding this lounge; on our first attempt at following the ""VIP"" signs we ended up at a different lounge where we could have stayed but we were advised that there was another lounge much closer to our gate which was in fact the case. It's a comfortable lounge and it didn't seem too busy even on a Friday evening. There are different types of seating including desks and tables as well as a lot of very comfortable armchairs. There is a very nice rest area which is kept in semi- darkness with beds where you can take a nap. There are plenty of drinks available including wines spirits coffee and various soft drinks. The food is a little disappointing consisting of a small range of sandwiches (a fresh batch was delivered while we were there and they seemed quite freshly made) and various other snacks. Nothing more substantial is available. There seems to be no more than 15 minutes of free wifi available which is rather disappointing for a business lounge. Together with the poor signage towards the lounge and the obvious lack of airport staff in general for the first- time visitor this lounge gets an average score from us. If you know where it is already then you may find it better. We did enjoy the chance to relax for a couple of hours before our departure though.",lounge
700,The lounge is a bit tired and Wi-Fi access is via a password at the reception area. In terms of refreshments the lounge has to be the worst I have ever experienced. Snacks were just about it and they were few and far between. There was a large basket of biscuit for cheese but no cheese on offer. When I enquired about this at reception I was curtly told “we offer sandwiches from 3pm. That's it!” I entered the lounge at 12:30pm. Some beer spirits and wine were available but not a great selection. There are no toilets in the lounge so to go you have to take everything with you and it's a trek!,lounge
701,What a disappointment. Canteen style food. Food served in metal canteen holders were a fitting receptacle for clumps of penne pasta and tomato sauce. Cheese served in the same metal container chunks of cheddar and indifferent blue. No wonder the majority were feasting on Kettle Chips as the only fresh oasis in a sea of processed food. We were tempted to slip next door to the One where we knew we could order a fresh cooked snack before boarding but instead we are hopeful that the food on board may be better and therefore we will maintain our appetites. Shame on BA for not show casing the Best of British fare when passengers are leaving the UK.,lounge
702,As a Qantas Club member my wife two young children and I were refused entry as our children were counted as guests. A few days earlier we were allowed entry to the BA lounge in Vancouver and we have never had problems with Qantas lounges. BA's policy here is unfair to families travelling with kids. To make matters worse I raised the issue with the 'manager' and experienced appalling customer service bordering on vindictiveness.,lounge
703,Not very well signposted to the location of the lounge I just happened to look left at the correct time! Excellent lounge though! Reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff. As the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out. Full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with Peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge. Hot drinks machine was working. A good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that weren't dry or tasteless. Nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings. A good selection pastries. In terms of comfort the seating was good. The furnishings and little details gave it the signature British Airways lounge feel. Lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that you'll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats. But the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being British we need to see it to believe it - by using the free Wi-Fi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible. Overall a fantastic terraces lounge outside of the UK. Much larger than required but not going to complain! Food on offer left me content and drinks on offer were of expected quality.,lounge
704,Visited this lounge on a late Monday afternoon. There were very few people in the lounge when we arrived so no problems finding a comfortable seat. The choice of food was very limited and the same as every time we use this lounge The only hot option was soup which although very good surely should not be the only choice in the middle of winter. Other options were salads cold pasta dish and sandwiches (which were beginning to curl at the edges!) The drinks available were as usual excellent with good wines good choice of spirits and non alcoholic beverages The staff were helpful and friendly. The only thing that lets this premium lounge down is the uninspired food choice.,lounge
705,There's almost nothing after customs except the BA Lounge. Great range of drinks and wines. Cheese and biscuits and a small range of sandwiches and wraps. No outside windows and quite small. Warm welcome. Comfortable seating.,lounge
706,It's a trip up a few escalators at the end of the Terminal 5 departure lounge. Once you are finally there it is a quiet and spacious haven with varous zones - you can use the internet relax on a sofa or at a table. There are various points for coffee and tea wines and spirits as well as a nice food area. For me it was morning and there was a selection of bacon rolls other hot breakfast items yoghurt sliced fresh fruits and juices. The washrooms were clean and shower facilites were also available. There is a similar lounge close to security but that is planned mainly for domestic/european passengers. The one at the far end of T5 is better.,lounge
707,Visited the BA Lounge Galleries South lounge in T5A prior to a long haul flight to Asia. Very welcoming staff on the front desk. Good selection of newspapers and magazines available. Decent wi-fi which permitted streaming. The cinema area is a good place to relax. Basic but filling selection of hot food available including cous cous pasta and jacket potatoes with various fillings. Good selection of wines available. Attentive staff seemed to be working in the lounge and lounge was kept clean and tidy. Only minor criticism is that on my several recent visits to this lounge it has been very busy or seemingly near capacity with trouble getting a seat anywhere near the buffet area or the sofa area that overlooks the main concourse and the coffee is of vending machine standard. Otherwise this is a very good facility.,lounge
708,Easy to find. Pleasant welcome. Comfortable seating and good view of airport. Varied and tasteful food. Direct access from the lounge to the plane. Just what a lounge should be.,lounge
709,Arrived at about 11am and the bacon and rolls were thankfully still available. Crowded when we first went in the lounge cleared toward midday. Bacon et al replaced by pastries and fruit.,lounge
710,A spacious comfortable lounge but the selection of food available is no where near as good as that available in LHR T5. However much better than most US airport lounges.,lounge
711,Compared to other BA lounges in the UK and abroad this one really sucks. The location is good as the lounge is circular overlooking the main airside lounge and with runway views. The seating was tired and food was almost non existant. We had a midmorning transatlantic flight with American (booked through BA) and there was no evidence of the bacon rolls and other delights we are used to in Terminal 5. Toilets were in poor condition and the staff were lacklustre to say the least.,lounge
712,Used the Concorde Room in the run up to the Olympics and the height of the school holidays but it wasn't over crowded. I booked a cabana which has a day bed tv free telephone writing desk bathroom and the option to order room service. The staff regularly walked around taking orders from passengers and were delivered efficiently and with a smile. The lounge was also cleared of any glasses plates etc and was kept very tidy. The spa treatment was also very good but you need to book in advance to be sure of a treatment. The food choices were excellent for both lunch and dinner accompanied by a selection of vintage champagnes and fine wines.,lounge
713,Great breakfast excellent service. However no massage slots available and sneered at for not booking in advance although never received any information or suggestion to do so. Was never required on previous flights to/from NY. Was spoken to as though I was a complete idiot for not booking before arriving and this was 3 hours before my flight.,lounge
714,Very small with no privacy. Close to gate so you can sit and watch plane being loaded. Poor selection of food and drink. Some strange sandwich fillings so ended up with a bag of crisps. WI-fi very slow. Toilets only had 2 cubicles to share with club lounge. Disappointing.,lounge
715,Lounge in terminal 1 is more comfortable compared to the one in terminal 2. Terminal 1 lounge offers a variety of newspapers alcohol drinks and the interior is just well tailored with a great view and good service.,lounge
716,Good lounge adequate in food choices drinks comfortable. Great views of the runways. Good internet facilities newspapers. Overall very pleasant just like the airport - highly recommend and much better than fellow lounges by Delta at JFK/ATL/LAX which I often go to as well.,lounge
717,Bright airy great views. Quite busy for 6.15 on Sunday morning but I guess there were a lot of passengers having arrived fro the US Far East and Australia. Lots of seating and quite varied seating from armchairs to bar stools. Staff exceptionally friendly. Food OK but plentiful. Could do with a few more sockets for charging iPhones etc. Overall a very good experience.,lounge
718,Pleasant enough lounge. Separate area for those who want to watch TV. Not a great selection of drinks food adequate. Plenty of power points. You don't get blinded by the sun in this lounge as you do in other areas of the airport including the walk to the lounge from Security.,lounge
719,The First Class lounge looks attractive and seemed classier than the Club lounge next door. The choice of drinks was reasonable with decent champagne but the quality of whiskey was rather low for a First class lounge. I used the showers in the Business Class lounge next door it was okay but I have certainly had better experiences. The real serious disappointment was the choice of food there were some cold sandwiches and packets of cheap cheese and a variety of crisps etc but nothing hot - a real let down.,lounge
720,Regular user of the two Czech airlines business/gold card lounges in Prague. The old lounge (terminal 1) is well placed with an excellent view of the apron and pleasant (albeit slightly zany) decor. The new Schengen area lounge (Terminal 2) is more functional in its decor and was placed by some stupid designer in a position with no view at all and little natural light. A little imagination and it could have been much better. Charming attendants in both lounges adequate food good drinks and good internet. Makes it worth maintaining the Czech airlines gold card.,lounge
721,There appear to be two lounges at Prague. The Crystal and another The Citigold which is supposed to be the better option. Considering the rest of the Airport which is spacious clean and serviceable the lounges were quite frankly awful. We had travelled BA Club Europe and were given passes to the Crystal Lounge. This offered a coffee machine and some nuts and limited seating. We then tried the Citigold as we have gold cards and this was not a lot better. They offered a fridge with some rather dry rolls and an assortment of cold salad pasta in individual pots. A plate of broken biscuits and solf drinks. The carpets looked pretty filthy and I was quite glad to get out of there Free wi-fi was available but we would probably have been better down at KFC in the main hall.,lounge
722,An excellent lounge plenty space comfortable and with good food. Significantly better than some of the lounges in T5.,lounge
723,Design is good plenty of different areas and types of seating excellent selection of beverages and good selection of food although not outstanding. Staff clear tables very quickly after passengers leave and are very helpful. A very comfortable experience overall - could possibly be improved by an area for sleeping.,lounge
724,I spent about 8 hours in the lounge complex at Heathrow T5 and was impressed about the constant changes of food throughout the day. I used the north south and satellite lounges and they had variations on the menus. The north and satellite lounges do have manned cloakrooms to store belongings whereas the south lounge you leave items at your own risk. The lounges were kept clean and tidy despite the constant churn of passenger use. If you are looking for peace and quiet the satellite terminal is the quietest and if you require champagne it is upon request. Shower and bathroom facilities were also very good and kept clean. Wifi is free and plenty of computers to use. A most enjoyable way to start a trip.,lounge
725,In the North wing of T5. It is huge although on a Sunday morning plenty of the seat were occupied. Usual fare - nosh a bit ordinary. Seat so-so on comfort. All a bit so so really.,lounge
726,"I was travelling on the daily BA flight to London we hit the lounge fairly early and there was nothing much to show in the way of snacks etc. In a conspiratorial voice we were told to tell the bar staff that we were flying with BA and so would not be charged for drinks and so forth (the prices for AA Passengers were ridiculous). We were also told that ""hot food"" would be available when the last AA flight departed. This proved to be soup and a tray of sandwiches some crudities and a dip. Seating was comfortable and staff were efficient and very helpful. Good views of the runway and ramps from the bar area. There were no showers and the bathrooms were not very modern and the fittings were in need of a makeover.",lounge
727,This is a rabbit warren to get around in. Reasonable to navigate around if you have a sense of direction and you can get your bearings. Good food and beverage range with attentive staff. Definitely no comparison to Qantas First Lounge at Sydney International but I imagine there aren't too many that would.,lounge
728,"When you present your First Class Boarding Passes to the First Reception Desk and are told ""you need to go over there"" (Club World Lounge) and you have to point out that you are a First Class passenger things do not bode well. The Lounge is okay but Champagne Bar doesn't keep the champagne chilled adequately. First Class dining room has quite a limited menu and isn't great. 6 months ago when I travelled First Class out of London we were invited to experience the dining room and presented an invitation to dine after a certain time. This practice has now gone - pity. In fact the hot self serve buffet had a better food choice than the dining area. Overall the First Class Lounge was okay but not great.",lounge
729,We arrived at the Lounge to be greeted by 4 friendly staff and encouraged to enter and relax. When we entered there were the best part of 150 people in it. We struggled to get the last two seats. We found out that they had closed the Business Class Lounge and put everyone into the First Class Lounge just to make us feel special I guess. Uncomfortable seating self serve basic buffet poor food and beverage to say the least. When we encountered a delay the staff were hopeless. Either inexperienced or incorrectly trained they could not cope or handle high yield passengers appropriately or properly. Choose another airport to transit with a better First Class Lounge.,lounge
730,This is probably the best Business Class Lounge that I have experienced. Bright refreshing and well equipped. Spacious and well fitted out. Enjoyable.,lounge
731,Excellent lounge with plenty of everything. Used it twice recently and it was quiet well-stocked with drinks food and papers and with plenty of room. Highly recommended.,lounge
732,British Airways share the Qantas lounge located near the gates which is nice. Welcome was friendly and staff attentive. Food selection is much better than in LHR and nice interesting choices. Lounge is quite spacious even though both BA flights and a Qantas flight were leaving at the same time. There are no views as the lounge is not near the windows of the airport. Showers are nice great water pressure and they use nice toiletries. Staff friendly and gave a small amenity kit. WiFi was strong and quick and the lounge was a serene place to relax.,lounge
733,A quiet and relaxed lounge with comfortable seating and superb views of the runways. There are facilities to leave bags and coats and private dining booths for breakfast and lunch. Food and drink is waiter service. Although afternoon tea does not feature on any menu the staff were more than happy to serve this for me. I used one of the cabanas where you have a day bed desk TV phone for free use and luxury bathroom facilities. You can order room service from your cabana. The Elemis Spa is located just outside the lounge but book a treatment early to avoid disappointment. For me using this lounge is part of my holiday before a long haul flight.,lounge
734,This was an exceptionally nice lounge albeit small for 2 flights departing close together. For the next year plus it is also to serve as the Admiral's Club for AA Needless to say it has gone from a little haven of peace to a typical US lounge facility. British Airways passengers and the staff clearly hate the situation.,lounge
735,This lounge shared between BA Iberia and American was spacious but laid out in a series of small rooms with a variety of seating options. On the day we were there it was not overcrowded. A good selection of drinks available the attended counter being closed. Food was pretty poor with only a few stale looking croissant sandwiches and soup on offer. The flight announcements were barely audible where we were seated and I had to go and check with the reception that it had indeed been our flight which had been called. Wi-fi and computer availability were good. Unfortunately the arrivals and departure screens only dealt with AA flights.,lounge
736,Spacious lounge with comfortable and quiet seating areas. The selection of food and beverage is excellent though service when ordering from the menu is slow. Many computer terminals and helpful staff at the inner Customer Service desk. The decorative glass screens between seating areas are lovely when lit if dark outside. The lounge location benefits from nice views of the tarmac and taxiways. The showers and Elemis Health Spa are located outside the lounge and shared with the Galleries Business Class Lounge that is located above.,lounge
737,Without a doubt the most miserable business lounge on this planet. Having travelled from London and using the fantastic BA lounge I had the misfortune to land in LA and through a reciprocal arrangement with BA I used the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge. It's a joke - you pay for almost everything the only free stuff consists of things like lukewarm and stewed instant coffee stale biscuits and a few bruised pieces of fruit. You get one drink voucher and no wifi access unless you are a member. Suggest you give this place and American Airlines a wide berth! Unfortunately my next leg is with American Airlines and no surprises you have to pay for in flight coffee and food! I will never fly with budget airline American Airlines again!,lounge
738,I was frankly very disappointed. Only half of the food on the bar menu was available and someone did tell me about other food options that were apparently available but they mumbled so much I have no clue as to what they said - at the third time of asking I gave up.,lounge
739,At the bag drop in Terminal 5 the British Airways staff member let me know that the Galleries North lounge would be much closer to my flight's departure gate than the South lounge. I had not used the North lounge before and went along there assuming it would be the same as the South lounge. In fact it was much less enjoyable. The North lounge is significantly smaller and was extremely crowded with almost all the seats taken. It was noisy hot and felt congested with passenger's carry-on bags filling the walkspace. The food selection was similar to the South lounge but the range of magazines available was very limited. Next time I will know to go straight to the South lounge whichever gate my flight leaves from and just leave the extra time to walk up to the gates at the north of the terminal.,lounge
740,Fairly large lounge visited on a Sunday evening. Standard Terraces comfortable recently updated free wi-fi. The staff are friendly and efficient at clearing tables and ensuring the limited offerings are kept up to date. Only one red and one white wine small selection of spirits and the food is only light snacks but what there is is of a good quality nice tartlets mini sandwiches etc). Overall a good experience it is a nice place to wait for a flight.,lounge
741,This is a newly refurbished lounge modelled on the Concorde Room at LHR. Very comfortable and plenty of space as this lounge is for exclusive use of BA passengers only travelling in First. The food and beverages were of high quality and a dining area if you wished to use it. The wifi was a bit slow so gave up in the end. The spa facilities are upstairs in the Terraces lounge and so are shower facilities.,lounge
742,A great lounge with plenty of high quality and comfortable seating. The dining options are extensive and there is also an extensive range of drinks to choose from. The private cabanas are good to use as you have more seclusion from the rest of the lounge and have your own bathroom day bed TV writing desk and you can order room service too. There is also a telephone in the room where you can phone for free anywhere in the world. The Boardroom has free computers and a printer and the seats are original Concorde chairs. There are secure storage facilities for your belongings and clean bathroom facilities.,lounge
743,The only hot food available were plastic containers of Two-Minute Noodles. Alcohol is served from a bar which is not always tended - you have to ring a bell and wait. The only other food is packets of crisps crackers cheese. The windows are blocked off by translucent blinds making it rather claustrophobic.,lounge
744,The Concorde Room really has lost its exclusive feel. It was very crowded and from the destinations people were travelling too full of passengers not travelling in First - it is supposed to be only for First passengers according to the BA hype. The staff spent much time discussing their work issues loudly in full hearing of the passengers. Staff do not actively patrol to see if anyone needs anything which is odd since nothing on offer is available self-service. Food service was O.K. but not very professional and the presentation on the plate would be fine for a transport caff. The whole deal falls short of what one expects of true first class service but of course that is typical of the whole experience on BA.,lounge
745,"SkyClub in Seattle was bright and spacious with clean well stocked bathrooms. Seating comfortable with excellent views of the apron. Front desk staff helpful and friendly. Food and beverage options are a lot better than United and American with some tasty soup, salad, bread and your usual snack options. My only gripe is the fact that they had disposable plates and utensils which is not classy at all. Service was decent, lounge staff were a bit timid for some reason. WiFi connection was fast which is always great. Overall, a decent lounge and DL definitely leads among the major US legacies when it comes to lounge food.",lounge
746,The Sydney Qantas First Lounge could quite possibly be the best first class lounge on the planet. Great menu premium restaurant style food cooked to order and service excellent. Drink menu and the spa are something else. If your into aviation and like seeing the air field activity and the planes coming and going the view is spectacular. Staff very attentive and the meals papers and Internet service excellent. I've travelled a bit First class and this lounge is the new standard. Five star comfort. Didn't really want to get on the plane.,lounge
747,The first class lounge in Houston is pathetic no showers and no food whatsoever except crisps and pre packed biscuits also no champagne. How can they call this First Class I don't know! Business Class lounge is better as they did have a few rather dried up sandwiches.,lounge
748,The business class lounge at the new Delta terminal at JFK is very disappointing. Poor layout meager offerings in the way of snacks and/or drinks overcrowded and a very poor set up when wanting to order a paid meal. It's very difficult and unclear as to know how to order food/drinks. Instructions at the tables are vague order placement terminals poorly placed and in general a bewildering experience. The seating is comfortable clean with good choices of seating areas. Lighting is comfortable Rest rooms are clean.,lounge
749,Bought a day pass as this is the only lounge at IND. While rather small it never seems over crowded. It has been kept clean and is an oasis of calm. For a domestic lounge Delta has really stepped up it's game on food offerings with a hot soup green and other salads flat breads and the usual raw veggies and packaged cheeses that used to be it. There is no view and no announcements so you need to keep your wit's about you especially if you are travelling on another airline. A variety of seating but no high tech massage chairs. Overall I was impressed.,lounge
750,"Large pleasantly appointed lounge on two levels with extensive views of the apron and one runway. A two teir bar system operates in the lounge the majority of drinks are free but items from the ""Luxury Bar"" ie. non domestic and premium spirits incur a charge. It was therefore possible to sit and drink Jack Daniels all day but if you wanted named Scotch bacardi and so forth you pay. Draft and bottle beers soft drinks and mixers are all free. We were in the lounge from 3 to 5pm and there was plenty of seating available staff were pleasant and efficient. Food was basic; crudities with dips two types of soup pre-packed rubber cheese and a delicious curried cous cous. OK it was basic but everything looked fresh and they kept it well stocked up. Showers were excellent with a good supply of the basic things you need for your grooming on offer before you enter and soap shampoo conditioner and towels ready in the shower area. Overall as good as most European lounges and better than many US ones.",lounge
751,Not much in the way of sandwiches or snacks on display but there were some cookies and a modest bar selection. The pre-flight dinner in a private dining area (across the hall actually in the Business Lounge) was excellent with a nice salad and well-prepared entree and a choice of excellent dessert. Nice choice of wines as well. The First lounge itself is actually rather small and feels a bit cramped - very pleasant staff however who let us know that our flight was boarding and were apologetic about the half-hour delay.,lounge
752,Huge lounge lots of people but no sense of being crowded. Superb selection of liquor including Grey Goose and other premium brands nice wine selection as well. Fairly extensive selection of snacks of all kinds - some of the sandwiches were superb. Huge area with many computer work stations with good high speed internet service.,lounge
753,Lounge operated by Qantas. Quieter than Business Class Lounge but the food selection was disappointing especially compared to Cathay Pacific. Wireless access was provided by the airport and it was difficult to connect. I don't think this lounge matches the standards of the First Class lounges operated by Cathay Pacific and British Airways.,lounge
754,The worst SkyTeam lounge I have ever visited. Ridiculously scarce collection of food and drinks. Another disappointing thing is that the personnel in the Santiago lounge did not care about how bad the service and presentation were. I do not even think that they were trained in the customer service. Shame on Delta!,lounge
755,One word to describe this lounge - horrendous. The lounge is ridiculously small with some people left standing while waiting for seats to become free. The seats themselves are worn and in some cases dirty. Some of the staff were friendly some less so. No hot food and not much cold food either. Delta should be ashamed. While US airline lounges don't compare with those of the European or Asian carriers Delta's Sky Clubs are the worst. My recent experience has shown that Admirals Clubs while not perfect are infinitely superior to Delta's. I like the Delta product in the air but my experience in their clubs has made me seriously consider changing allegiance to American.,lounge
756,I travel frequently and this is one of the worse lounges I have been in. At check in the person in charge was on the phone and I had to wait for 10 minutes. The bar was fine but the bathrooms were appalling. I ended up going to the public bathroom in the terminal. No only the design is bad (3 cubicles about 5 feet tall) but the sinks were dirty the 3 paper towel machines were empty and there was trash on the floor. Who killed customer service and the glamour of travel?,lounge
757,Although this lounge is modelled on the First Galleries at T5 it does not live up the service and quality of the Concorde Room. However it is a quieter lounge as the BA flights departing from here leave late in the evening so it's not an issue to book a spa treatment. The menu choices were uninspiring and no afternoon tea served. Pre-flight dining however was much better.,lounge
758,T5 galleries super for relaxing or working well designed seating areas. Newspapers & magazines in various locations internet computers fax and copiers. Choice of snacks and well stocked bars. The staff are unobtrusive but on hand if you require assistance.,lounge
759,The lounge was spotless and I was greeted warmly by the man behind the desk even though I wasn't travelling with BA and had entered the lounge via Priority Pass. The toilets were clean bar soft drinks and food was all well stocked and the papers and magazines were all current. There's a TV and a monitor displaying flight times. The man in the lounge was so helpful he even let us know when our non BA flight was boarding!,lounge
760,Deplorable. Snacks and sandwiches were days old-the kimchi was rotten they only had Budweiser beer and sweet wines.,lounge
761,Absolute con- just meant to make money off economy class passengers who are led to believe they are paying for luxury. The worst airline lounge I have ever been to. They charge business class passengers for drinks at the 'luxury bar' at Atlanta and it was the worst Bloody Mary I ever had - always thought they was a safe choice. The seats at Chicago were uncomfortable. The lounges were dirty. I will never take a codeshare flight where Delta is a partner. I am worried that they will now destroy the Virgin lounges considering the fact that they own most of Virgin.,lounge
762,This is a contract lounge shared with several airlines including Delta. I was not permitted to invite a guest although I was flying business class and hold a crown Room membership. This is one of the worst international business class lounges - seating is poor - very few tables (I needed to use the floor to place my beverage as there was no table available). Food and drink selection is poor.,lounge
763,I went back to this lounge and was surprised to find that they are transforming the outdated Terraces Lounge into a new Galleries lounge similar to ones at Heathrow airport. The selection of hot food remains poor with only soup available but there was the same selection of cold food and drinks. The lounge was extremely busy but there was enough room.,lounge
764,Once passed security there are two lounges. Tip provided to me by the reception was use the lounge by Gate30 as it has only 9% occupancy. Took the advice and wandered in to a haven of peace and quiet. The food/drink selection was good. Staff were polite and helpful where required.,lounge
765,Very small lounge but well staffed and stocked. There was no aircon however which made it very uncomfortable on a day when it soared to 36 celsius. Mobile phones must be switched off. Ricard was the only spirit on offer.,lounge
766,Not a large lounge and with a limited selection of free snacks and drinks (there is also a bar) but clean and quiet. Located in Terminal S from which most (but not all) Delta flights depart. Our flight departed from another terminal so we had to take an elevator down to the terminal level then another (or escalator) down to a train to take us to our terminal.,lounge
767,JFK Skyclub lounge is so disappointing after experiencing KLM's in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam you get great food snacks: good breads and cheeses croissants etc. At JFK it's basically just drinks and things that go with drinks as if no one wants to eat anything but carrot sticks and olives. I was upgraded on my next flight from JFK to DTW at dinner time and on that flight in FIRST CLASS there was just a basket of junk food of the kind you'd get at a 7/11. Delta seems to think all people want are drinks. I'm Gold Medallion and was glad for the privilege of the Skyclub lounge in Amsterdam (KLM's) but Delta in JFK (and I imagine elsewhere) is much inferior.,lounge
768,First time we used the rather new (remodeled) lounge in the international terminal (F). Large comfortable. Plenty of showers. Outdoor patio appended to the main lounge area was nice. Small but decent selection of free snacks beverages. Clean. Can take some time to get from here to domestic gates but not a big problem.,lounge
769,Small but very well set lounge with wine bar and eating area business area in far corner. Staff friendly and flights are called. No signs of cut backs.,lounge
770,This lounge has no windows. It comprises three or four box like rooms including the dining room. The lounge is comfortable and well supplied with drinks and biscuits. The selection of sandwiches was poor two choices plus a wrap of some sort. The pre flight dinner which BA offers for overnight flights to London was cold or lukewarm. Hardly surprising when the chef spent most of his time on the internet in the business section of the lounge instead of in the kitchen! The exception was the excellent sweetcorn chowder of which I had two bowls as the rest of the food was stale and uninviting. Not a patch on the preflight dinner I enjoyed a couple of years ago at JFK. I don't know if this is yet another sign of the diminishing standards with BA or just a lazy chef. No showers either. The rest of the staff were very helpful and gave good service.,lounge
771,Large and airy lounge with plenty space which is needed at busier times as gets fairly congested! Good selection papers magazines etc. Food readily available and plenty of it! Well cooked too and replenish regularly at busy times. Good selection of alcoholic/non- alcoholic drinks too!,lounge
772,As a very frequent flyer my wife and I think that this is the worst lounge we have ever been in. The staff on front desk surly and totally not interested in their customers who pay their wages they need to be reminded food options non existent. Coffee machine broken not in use . I think Delta need to look around and maybe visit their Atlanta lounge. All in all a very bad advertisement.,lounge
773,This lounge is used by SkyTeam airlines here at Narita and what a poor reflection on SkyTeam as an airline alliance. Why is it that airline lounges operate by US carriers offer such second rate standards with this Delta lounge being cheap overcrowded and very dirty by Japanese standards? The breakfast offering food-wise is quite pitiful some cereals yogurt and low quality pastries - is this what I get when flying First Class with a SkyTeam airline? Washrooms were dirty the showers at best a 2-Star standard. In other words this is a lounge to avoid if you are used to the higher standards normally found in Asia and Japan. My last trip out of Narita was with ANA and the ANA Suite lounges are so so superior to the poor standards that US airlines such as Delta provide.,lounge
774,This is a joke lounge it's really like sports bar. I had to pay for everything nothing was free apart from nuts and carrots. I had prosecco and sushi which was very wrong - really hard rise huge sushi.. Came up $36. I should have just hang out at the gate as it was so far away to get there couldn't be bother to go back again.,lounge
775,Worse than any other lounge ever experienced regardless of class of travel! To be fair airport undergoing renovations at time but that did not excuse the poor quality and availability of decent edible food! Poor selection of drinks and lacklustre service. Worst of all the air conditioning was not working and felt like being in a sauna for an hour before flight took off. Avoid like the plague!,lounge
776,Calm environment in which to relax pre/post flight. Tastefully decorated and plenty of quiet spaces where it is possible to gain some privacy from others. Good cabanas to refresh and catch up on some sleep between flights. Full dining facilities enable one to get maximum sleep on board if overnight flight. Plenty of decent Champagne too! A proper first class facility if only this could be transposed onboard!,lounge
777,I have spent many hours in the SEA Skyclub the last few months. Recently Delta has been testing new food offerings here including soup cold sandwiches and hot and cold appetizers. The soup and sandwiches are a welcome addition and might quiet some of the criticism in these comments. Other criticisms have been the presence of children in some of the delta clubs. Personally I found the children refreshing and much more interesting than the folk that typically populate the clubs. Delta has solved that problem too as they will soon begin to charge $29 per guest including family members unless you purchase a $700 executive membership. The SEA club has a great staff especially the bartenders. The complementary alcohol though is poor quality and the Luxury Bar drinks are not cheap. The seating in this club is generally uncomfortable except for the quiet room. This lounge needs additional electric outlets in the seating areas. There is only one shower but usually not a wait for it. Wifi is always good.,lounge
778,Decent quiet reliable lounge. Was able to have a relaxing wait at SeaTac before my recent flight to CDG. Like most US airline lounges the food was basic and unadventurous but there were just enough satisfying items (among them some good soups that I actually had several helpings of). No showers in the bathroom I think but the washrooms were clean.,lounge
779,Large lounge considering the size and throughput of the airport - Druk Air only has two A319 Airbus and no-one else flies there. Comfortable sofas and easy chairs. Reasonable selection of drinks (although the fridge was not connected) - only a tin of biscuits for snacks. Washroom facilities other side of security so you have to go through but they let you back when you show your Boarding Card!,lounge
780,One of a group of lounges in Terminal D all operated by one company but with separate identities and side by side. Pleasant helpful staff and plenty of drinks and nibbles. The concierge announced that new sandwiches had arrived! First lounge is off the Business. Just one male and one female loo and a small business centre. Plenty of newspapers. Compared with the nearby Admiral's Club an oasis of calm and style.,lounge
781,This Galleries lounge is very similar to the ones in T5 although it is much smaller. They have the same choice of food and drinks and similar facilities. It is extremely quite due to the small number of BA flights out of T3 and the downside is the lack of natural light (the windows are quite narrow) and the lack of atmosphere. Even the BA staff looked bored and not very welcoming.,lounge
782,Very impressive from the welcome at the door to every member of the staff encountered. Lovely ambience with a lot of room to move around. Took lunch in the Dining Room which was the only disappointment.,lounge
783,Lounge was somewhat of a joke. Interior definitely done on the cheap. Food consisted of crackers and some mystery dip. Room not clean with tables that had not been picked up by employees for some time. Annoying children with parents who think the room is a play ground. My wife and I left after 15 minutes shaking our heads in disgust. We would rather wait at the gate at this airport.,lounge
784,No food but crackers and carrots this is terrible I guess we are all to eat like rabbits and drink like fish? They use to be good with hot snacks bread and other finger foods. This frustrating when the cost of the flights went up a lot and the service went way down. This last time my company with book with Delta business class and we are platinum members.,lounge
785,Had to pay 50 dollars despite having a first class ticket as flight was within USA. All that was provided was cheese and biscuits but could have drunk unlimited booze. Reasonably comfortable and free wifi but became a little crowded as time went and clearing of tables slow. Poorest lounge of all I have been in.,lounge
786,The best thing about the BA lounge at Newcastle is the staff. I fly every week so have got to know them and they are always professional and courteous. Lounge a bit old and worn now but don’t expect BA will upgrade (they only seem to be in the business of downgrading everything these days). Good selection of drinks. Sandwiches at lunchtimes nice freshly prepared and a good selection. A nice place to wait for an hour or a bit longer. The staff are the same two or three very pleasant ladies – wish BA would commission them to train their FA colleagues in customer centricity! One negative - just one loo and it has never flushed properly since my two years using it.,lounge
787,The lounge in Terminal 5 at Stockholm-Arlanda is very basic. It is shared with other OneWorld partners and I believe is part of the Priority Pass network. The lounge is rather soulless and lacking in comfort and style. There are just medium-sized seats spread out over the lounge. The food was basic and mediocre consisting mainly of cheese and ham bread rolls and what appeared to be a quinoa salad. The standard fizzy drinks on offer. Curiously red and whte wine was available but in a beer-like pouring mechanism. In short there is no need to get to the airport early to enjoy this lounge because there is not much to enjoy unlike other BA lounges.,lounge
788,Delta management either doesn't visit lounges outside the U.S. or doesn't care how poor the lounges they offer are. Lounges outside the USA have hot food and it's free. Drinks are free. First Class ticket gets you in. Now enter the Delta Lounge's in there home airport Atlanta. Coach snacks and alcohol. Wifi that is slow. Overcrowding. According to staff at ATL the biggest complaint is no hot food like the rest of the world. Now Delta is opting for a $695 annual fee for frequent fliers and Diamond travelers will have to pay in one year/January 2015. I'm not sure what Delta is trying to prove with this new scheme. Perhaps to let everyone know that they care more about executive pay and bonuses than the customer. Personally I'm now going to stop my loyalty to Delta and start using other better airlines. Diamond status means nothing anymore.,lounge
789,It has been expanded and improved. Granted the food choices were still somewhat limited but the choices had increased in number. In addition there are now showers set up.,lounge
790,Pleasant small lounge with reasonably comfortable seating. Good views of stands and an open area outside originally used for us smokers but now banned. Shame! No hot food but fresh sandwiches and cakes. An adequate selection of drinks. As there is only one flight a day I was surprised there were not more people.,lounge
791,The door to the lounge is just a few feet from the security check - very convenient. A lot of chairs sofas etc. Good looking bar. Outside space has a good-ish view of planes and side view of runways. WC's were so-so. Booths are brilliant. I had a superb breakfast which was serve piping hot and very quickly. Didn't try the other goodies.,lounge
792,Very quiet in the middle of the day - we had 7 hours to wait between flights with our 2 year old daughter - an amazing kids room in the lounge with soundproof glass walls. You can sit outside and relax and watch the kids inside. Very good idea! Great selection of French and european wine great nibbles. Only downside - Coffee machine made terrible coffee and the restaurant did not open for the entire 7 hours we were there (not enough clients??). Still had the snack menu but no sit down fine dining as advertised. At 6.30pm it had still not opened for dinner and after asking and getting no response we left to catch our flight. I am still confused as to what was going on here. Free PCs with internet too.,lounge
793,This lounge is a disgrace. The place isn't clean; the services terrible; the food non-existent; the bar more like a sports bar than a place for first class passengers to rest and wait - in short its a degraded facility much like the airline that runs it is a degraded airline. Delta should close it and go back to its former lounge services. This one (terminal 5) was/is awful.,lounge
794,Crowded noisy uncomfortable poor snack items - but still probably better than being out on the concourse. We tried both Sky Clubs on the B Concourse. We spent most of our time in the lounge near B25. The place was packed but we did find two chairs. The place was packed with people many of whom were yapping on their cellphones. A fair number of families some with babies who were shrieking and children who used the lounge like a gym. The snack offerings were minimal some veggies cookies pretzels etc. The espresso machine took too long to dispense a simple cup of regular coffee (no airpots). The bathrooms were a disaster - dirty smelly and as others have mentioned with the cheapest toilet paper.,lounge
795,I've been a Delta Diamond flyer for the last year of so which gives me access to the lounge. I have written to complain about the speed of the wifi several times but they haven't done anything to improve it. I am sitting in the lounge right now connected using the access point on my phone. 6 months ago they did not charge for any of their draft beers. Now only one beer is complementary - and it isn't a good one. All I want is a nice local brew like Booklyn Lager. The complementary cabernet is Sycamore Lane - its not good either. I also tried the Merlot by the same folks. not good. I'm not a cheap guy but I'm a bit annoyed about this change. If I way paying for a business class ticket or paying for louge access I'd really be angry. I have the same comments as one of the previous posters. I'm sitting here in the lounge and there are literally 4 empty glasses from previous patrons within arms reach. Last week I got off the redeye and tried to come in to use a shower. They said it would be an hour wait. This is completely unacceptable.,lounge
796,New lounge looks good and is for BA use only. Selection of hot and cold food which was very tasty and well presented. We were on the day flight with using the 777 so lounge was very quiet. Would presume it would be busy for the evening 747 flight.,lounge
797,Lounge is comfortable enough using the same furniture as the new lounges at Heathrow T5. The problem is mosquitos that have come in not a few-but a massive amount. The catering is poor old fruitcake stale cheese and a few Indian dishes guaranteed to give stomach problems - nobody touched them! Yet they have four attendants standing around doing nothing - why spend all the money for a new lounge?,lounge
798,This lounge is a rather standard BA lounge but it does have some major flaws. Capacity is a big problem in this lounge. I have rarely been in a lounge of this size where I have not not been able to find any seating whatsoever. The lounge was absolutely packed! It was so full that I decided to leave after a while because it was not worth the effort to find some personal space in the lounge. I wanted to go on-line but apart from two free computers wireless was at a charge. I paid quite a hefty charge and I had major problems trying to connect. I could only spend five minutes on-line and I was constantly disconnected. In summary there is significant room for improvement!,lounge
799,The T4 SkyClub at JFK is the largest and newest SkyClubs in Delta's system. This lounge has a SkyDeck an open-air observation deck with a great view of the terminal area and runways. There are plenty of outlets for recharging with complimentary wifi. Inside you can order a hot meal or snack at prices that are competitive. This is the only SkyClub where you can get a meal or enjoy usual assortment of light snacks found in all SkyClubs. There is free beer wine and liquor but to get higher quality booze and a wider selection you have to pay. There are six shower rooms. The attendants keep a waiting list which seems to move quickly. Each room comes with amenities. There is a good variety of newspapers. SkyClubs that are in locations formerly run by Northwest Airlines do not have this problem.,lounge
800,This lounge is quite large but it does not have enough seats or space for the numbers of people passing through! There was a line out the door at one point to enter. The toilets inside were the same as the ones outside. The food on offer is the same as all Delta lounges which is limited to some raw vegetables with humus chips pretzels and other cheap snack foods. Drinks are similarly uninspired. They had special Johnny Walker drinks but for $15 extra per drink! The seats were stained from overuse. All the passengers were all hooked up to their in-ear phones and speaking loudly to people somewhere else about business making it really loud and strange. The only good thing about the lounge is the fact you get free wifi. As a passenger on an international connection in business class I was allowed to enter. You would have to be insane to pay $50 for a day pass to enter this place.,lounge
801,The Sky Club at SAN is opened three weeks ago. The terminal also appears to be fairly new; so there is a very clean open and inviting feeling to it. The staff was very proud of their lounge and had a great attitude. The furniture was comfortable and there appeared to be an ample supply of electrical outlets. This lounge has a Luxury Bar which means you can pay to get high quality wine and liquor. The complimentary spirits are barely palatable but they are free. The food is the standard SkyClub packaged cheese pretzels etc. Nothing you could make a meal out of. The highlight of this lounge is that it opens on to a large balcony that overlooks the gate area! Delta has furnished this area with rocking chairs so it feels like you are sitting on your front porch but looking out over the terminal. Neat. I was there for a late night flight so the airport was relatively quite. I wonder if it would be noisy sitting on the balcony when the airport is busy. For a domestic lounge Delta did a good job with this one. It was fun.,lounge
802,"I visited one lounge in the main part of T5 only to see a ""Boarding Now"" sign for my flight which was not departing for nearly 2 hours. It turns out they were trying to get people to the T5B satellite because of enhanced security procedures. I made my way over to T5B and used the lounge there - not crowded and plenty of food good wifi access free computers to use. All in all a pleasant quiet place to spend time before flight. One negative for BA: when I arrived at Heathrow a week previously - the Arrivals lounge at T5 had already closed promptly at 2pm. This seems very early given that the 2nd schedule SFO-LHR flight arrives at 2 pm.",lounge
803,One would have thought that British Airways/Jersey would have taken notice of R Pemberton's review of this lounge - 12 August 2009. Absolutely nothing has changed - for the better that is. At the time of my visit (late afternoon) dirty crockery was strewn across the tables. The elderly male attendant did not even bother to look up when I entered so no check of my credentials and certainly not greeting. It may be that BA Jersey are trying to save on electricity but I could not find any other reason for all the ceiling lights being switched off. There are table lamps but it was difficult to read the dog-eared newspapers on the shelves. Carpets and upholstery are still filthy so no change there. I used the newly built lavatory which appeared not to have been cleaned that day. I live in Jersey and this is my local airport. What sort of impression does this hellhole make on departing passengers?,lounge
804,The recent experience of the BA Terraces lounge at Gatwick was one of total shock - since my last visit in October. 50% of the facility has been closed - what was on two floors providing a very good experience - is now an insult to every BA Club World customer - as it is now located on 1 floor. Passengers cannot find seats (due to overcrowding) - and me and my family of 4 had to half stand and half sit as we ate our snack breakfast. BA's cost cutting has reached a new and deeply insulting low in the way it treats it's premium customers - thankful I am flying with another airline this month to New Zealand.,lounge
805,The Lounge is good nothing much. Snacks only and you can't get food from outside. You can't really find a place to sleep or relax sometimes it's nearly full. Recommended only if you are staying a long time at the airport.,lounge
806,What a disappointment this lounge is. Carrots celery olives cheese & crackers are the free food choices. There is a restaurant in the lounge but we went outside to order. There were dirty dishes throughout the lounge and no one seemed eager to clean up. Thread bare towels that I am not even sure were clean. We spent good money for two Business class tickets to Italy had to spend 4 hours in JFK.,lounge
807,It is insulting that after having paid a premium for a business class ticket you are then required to pay for virtually everything in its lounge - unless you are satisfied with 'yogurt-covered pretzels' and a mass-produced domestic bottled beer. Another first is being required to present your passport at check-in. The space has had some thought put into its design but the lighting is very bright and customer service indifferent at best. This is in no way an international lounge (nor airline) on par with those of its partners KLM and Air France. Instead head across T4 to the Oasis Lounge where the bar is open food free and Faux Noise isn't blaring over the chatter. And you're not required to show your passport.,lounge
808,This is a very cold and dull lounge. The staff are far from welcoming - it's as if you have ruined their day just by being there. As someone else mentioned there is evidence of cost cutting throughout - fine for those in economy but not what one expects after paying so much more for a business class experience. The refreshments on offer were pathetic. I was there for an early morning flight and there were baskets of mini croissants and pan au chocolat cereal toast and coffee/juices etc. 100% self-service. Miserable staff hanging around like vultures ready to clear your table before you have finished swallowing your last mouthful. You can go out to the duty free shops but they don't bother to offer to look after your bags and coats so you need to lug them around with you if you are carrying anything of value which I usually am (laptop etc).,lounge
809,Arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport a little early in order to check out BA/QF first class lounge. Very disappointed. Nothing special - if anything the Business Class lounge opposite was as good if not better. The First lounge was small very limited food - cheese platter 2 choices two types of rolls and wraps. Only difference between business and First was choice of wines and champagne.,lounge
810,The lounge in Miami needs a total refurbishment its old fashioned with a poor selection of food. A real let down.,lounge
811,Sitting in lounge right now. The new outdoor area is nice but charging $3 for a beer? What kind of lounge does that? Have beer prices risen that much? Terribly slow wifi connection and the lounge gets really crowded. Food selection is nothing compared to other international lounges.,lounge
812,Disappointed to see the same old in JFK. Here you pay for anything beyond lousy wine and celery/crackers/olives. They have even eliminated cheese! I fly monthly business-class to London - and whilst I enjoy the Delta lounge at Heathrow I find the new JFK T4 lounge another American embarrassment - why can't we behave as other lounges do?,lounge
813,Not worth the extra cost in my opinion. The lounge was busy - it was difficult to get a seat. The breakfast was paltry - tiny croissants for instance. There was no sense of luxury - an air of convenience and cost-effectiveness. Staff were not particularly polite.,lounge
814,Though this lounge is very new it really is not big enough to handle the 2 flights which leave quite close together in the evening. The staff however are exemplary - very welcoming professional and friendly with a real sense of enjoying their interaction with the passengers. There is a good selection of food and drinks with very acceptable pre-flight dining. If only the T5 lounges were the same as this one.,lounge
815,Shocked is all I can say. After trying the Concorde Lounge earlier in the year the Terraces was a huge let down. We got to the airport 4 hours before the flight yet told the spa was full. The food was mediocre we had to ask for champagne. It was comfortable enough and the wifi was good.,lounge
816,"Arrived to airport by 6 am, my flight was by 9am. I was directed to Royal lounge by check in staff. Reach to the lounge downstairs, we found it closed and the staff said we open by 7am! This is ridiculous. Back again to information desk, he recommend other lounge far away from the gate. Lounge was too cold, food is not good. Very poor welcome from the staff at reception. I
think Egyptair should wake up to the condition of business class lounge and send staff for more training on how to welcome customers.",lounge
817,I am writing this while sitting in the lounge for a KLM flight. Large lounge with a restaurant in the middle. Complimentary food served here some veggy crackers olives and cheese. Soft drinks cheap red and white wine and beer complimentary - anything else needs to be paid for. Shame on you KLM using this lounge. This lounge has earned the medal for the worst.,lounge
818,A lot less cosy than what I remembered visiting this lounge 6 years back. I suppose the fact that it was really crowded made it more like a higher end gate waiting lounge than a business class lounge. There were lots of corners where you can potentially find your own corner but I think that the place is approaching overcapacity. There is a good selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages available (with Blue Moon Belgian beer on tap!) and a healthy selection of munchies as well as coffee. Wifi was fast and reliable and there were enough TV screens to help while the time away while waiting for boarding. Toilets were in horrible condition.,lounge
819,Lounge is very poor in comparison to other airlines business lounges throughout the world. Only 2 showers for which you have to register your name and be called when they are available. Food selection is basic snack type but not readily replenished. Layout is not very well optimised and seating is limited. Overall appearance was drab & uninviting. Certainly does not live up to the description on their website.,lounge
820,As a Gold card member I could use this lounge (unlike Heathrow's Concorde lounge which is exclusive for 1st passengers) as I awaited my flight to Antigua. Carpet very worn and dull as was most of the chairs and seating; everything felt like a 60s time warp. Food/breakfast was OK - nothing to speak about. Coffee machine appeared to be the only thing different to the club terraces option. Disappointing.,lounge
821,It's the attentive staff that makes this lounge a real pleasure. Staff members have always gone the extra mile to deal with seating upgrade and flight change and other special requests. Efficiency and smiles are a great combination. Food and drink are average but adequate. Too bad the washrooms are outside the lounge.,lounge
822,This lounge is shared by BA and Qantas and doesn't have many seats. So unless you get there quite early you might find it difficult to find a seat. The seats are old and need a make over. The choice of drinks is limited. Only one red one white and one sparkling wine (not champagne). The choice of food was limited to nuts fruit cold finger sandwiches cheese and crackers and Asian snacks (very tasty). Okay selections of newspapers no TV screens and a limited number of IT stations with one out of order. The lavatories were clean and so were the shower rooms.,lounge
823,The lounge was dirty there was a very cool unwelcoming reception from the female at the desk who was extremely unhelpful. The quality of the food and drinks available was pitiful. All in all a really bad experience and Egyptair should wake up very quickly and rectify the problem quickly.,lounge
824,Upgraded to business class because I had a 7 hour stopover in Cairo before travelling to Manchester England. I expected a reasonable comfortable stay. How wrong I was! The seating was extremely uncomfortable and not too clean the food and drinks on offer were at best mediocre. The lounge was air conditioned and thus cold. I never removed my outdoor coat and was still really cold. I feel I wasted money upgrading for something I didn't get. The flights were good but the stay in the lounge abysmal.,lounge
825,Don't expect anything special in Cairo with the exception of staff and their service. For the smokers they have a dedicated lounge. Type of food and drinks are limited and there are very few television screens to watch the news or sports.,lounge
826,Visited both Delta lounges in Minneapolis. Lounge C was extremely quiet also has a nice view of planes landing and taking off and I believe its bigger than the other one. The self-service bar still exists there. The other lounge at terminal F/G is more modern more of open and the bar is more lively but there's no open bar there. Both lounges : same snack pretzels hummus crackers apples coffee and some newspapers. Free fast internet connection and excellent staff. I spent 10 minutes at the LAX lounge more snacks but it was relatively crowded.,lounge
827,"Regular visitor as Diamond member over many years. Continue to be disappointed in the food assortment of Delta lounges. Standard fare are crackers plastic wrapped cheese slices seasoned pretzel/nuts rather than healthy nuts bagels carrot and celery sticks. Why not a better selection of fruit real fruit juices rather then the high fructose ""fruit"" drinks some decent bread and yogurt selection some warm snacks/pastas such as offered at other clubs. We do not expect Delta to reach the 5 star quality of Singapore airlines and others but this is barely making for a 3-star experience. It even pales with the 3-star rating of KLM and Air France sky team partners. One can fly to various locations worldwide for 70% of the Delta business fare on Singapore Airlines and Emirates for example and have a 5-star experience. Business class fares on Delta have gone out of sight (especially for what is offered as a package)!",lounge
828,Very disappointing. Delta does not have a lounge in Rome. I have a priority pass. My husband did not bring his priority pass so we paid for him. Alitalia lounge was very hot air quality is bad. I am here at the lounge writing this review. The women at the desk one in particular did not even raise her face to ask me what I need. I wanted to ask if there is wifi! Very rude people and the lady trying to clean the tables was rude. We are not eat anything nor drinking anything for it is very uncomfortable. Delta should investigate this relationship with Alitalia and to tell people that in Rome they do not have a lounge. They should refund me or priority pass should also investigate this shameful behavior and unhealthy condition no air conditioning.,lounge
829,"There is a daily flight to/from Gatwick from Antigua and it is a disGrace that BA use this shoddy ""shared"" lounge - landside at Antigua VC Bird Airport. Its like a tomb - windows are shuttered and those not - look into a large waiting area that never seems to be used. An array of snacks are left on the sideboard - a bit of cheese and raw vegetables - drinks are served by a waiter. Dire - if you travel to Antigua and miss it dont worry about it.",lounge
830,The BA lounge in MXP is an old style terrace lounge. The lounge is very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming. The food served is quite good all Italian style focaccia sandwiches small pizzas etc. The choice of drinks is good with lots of typical Italian drinks available. Good selection of newspapers and a few IT stations although only one was working properly. There was also a smoking room available. Dirty plates and glasses were cleared continuously.,lounge
831,Convenient and spacious. Helpful staff. Limited food and drinks but pleasant. Although fairly new starting to look jaded. Chairs grubby walls and toilet areas dirtier than they should be. Isn't going to wear well unless upgraded and deep cleaned.,lounge
832,We used these lounges twice there are four of them with different names but all essentially the same. There is no alcohol (there is none on any Egyptair flights as well). Food/juices are okay nothing phenomenal. Bathrooms were clean though no showers or anything. Check-in on the main concourse for the First/Business class area has lounge-like furniture coffee table and WiFi access.,lounge
833,Smallish lounge but quite comfortable. Excellent free wifi. No alcohol but nice range of soft drinks and juices. Only negative was no showers. I asked at the desk when I entered and they told me there are no showers in the whole airport. That should be remedied.,lounge
834,Probably the poorest lounge I ever saw on a great international airport. Awkward seats and tables and in particular no reasonable food. Only some nuts and crackers along with small cheese pieces packed in plastic foil. On the plus side: rest rooms clean. Cheapest toilet paper quality you can imagine though.,lounge
835,There were 2 lounges at the Delta terminal the smaller one near security check was much more quiet less folks self-service bar terrible snacks showers which was fine. The larger one was full of people kids full-service bar larger selection (and maybe better) quality of food. Very comfortable great wifi.,lounge
836,Recently visited 2 different Sky Club lounges in Atlanta terminals T and A. Club entrances are hidden down short halls and poorly marked. No inviting feeling to entering the lounges. Staff and the check in desks were friendly and helpful. The overall appearance is that of a tired out of date environment. Lounges seemed cramped and small. Furniture in the A terminal was actually dirty and stained. The snacks appeared old and picked over. Bathrooms were old looking cramped and dirty. The Delta staff were the only good part of the experience. The American Airline Admirals Clubs in Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth put the Atlanta clubs to shame for overall appearance and welcoming feeling.,lounge
837,This is a shared lounge used by several airlines - pleasantly surprised with plenty of seating available. Lounge looks modern with lots of natural daylight spacious clean. On one side is quite a large bar. No self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you - I think this gives a more personal service. On the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches. Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T5 where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often. When my flight was called the gate was literally 30 feet away. This lounge certainly was a relaxing retreat away from the crowds and I wish more were like this.,lounge
838,This is easily the poorest of all the BA 1st class lounges I have frequented. It is a reasonably large space which fills up very rapidly within a few hours of the 2 to 3 late night flights back to London. Very often you will struggle to find a comfortable seat. I no longer eat anything in this lounge as the quality of the catering is not up to scratch. You will hardly ever find a UK newspaper (unless you are 3-4 hours early) and I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this lounge - not even a good view. It is well overdue a complete refurbishment and the general decor is grubby and tatty. Singapore - London is a very busy route for BA and presumably therefore somewhat profitable. If you travel the same route with Singapore Airlines the lounges are far superior as is the general lounge service.,lounge
839,This lounge is in the newly opened T3 at Cairo Airport. It was dirty and staffed by bored surly individuals. The drink offerings were minimal and food was a choice of dried up croissants or mini pizzas. The irony is that the open eating areas at this airport are now really good. How does Egyptair manage to retain its Star Alliance membership? Take my advice at Cairo avoid the lounge and enjoy some good food in the public eating areas.,lounge
840,Used the new Star Alliance/Egyptair business lounge at Cairo airport terminal 3. Very disappointing. All the newspapers were in Arabic and no magazines. Warm soft drinks stacked on a table and loud children everywhere. There are two rooms one with a nice view of the runways that was jam packed and another which is rather grim that was also pretty full. The floors are tile and echo sounds horribly. Some sandwiches and finger foods and a kettle with hot water. No television or flight monitors in room number two. The staff were indifferent and uninterested in the passengers. Frankly waiting in the main terminal in the food court area offered more options for food/beverages and was just as comfortable as the lounge. Disappointing and not much of an improvement over the old dismal terminal 2 business lounge.,lounge
841,Hidden in between gates at the degrading Memphis International Airport. The desk staff are generally curt and rude which I have come to expect at airport lounges. Open full bar consists of self-pour liquor. Pretty decent brands not top-shelf or anything but respectable. The house wines are decent enough i.e. a step above boxed wine. The snacks are laughable carrots celery packaged ranch mixed nuts and crackers abound. The bar area wasn't that clean either. The advantage of this lounge is that it is quiet (in spite of how many people were there) a function of the numerous small rooms. The chairs are comfortable and the soft lighting was nice. Free WIFI NYT and WSJ as well. Bathrooms leave something to be desired.,lounge
842,On most concourses they lounges are located upstairs so it's either a lengthy wait for an elevator or the stairs. For those of you who have not been to ATL it's hot! When you arrive in this lounge it's crowded and you have to request beers. The food is usually old and looks picked over. Some of the seating is comfortable others not. It's not a terrible place to go for a drink while you wait for your flight but the VIP feeling is lacking.,lounge
843,For international flights departing from Brussels Skyteam Elite and Elite plus members use the British Airways lounge - quality and service are top notch! The front desk people are friendly and helpful. The seating is mediocre but drink and food selection make up for that. They have the most delicious pastries in the morning. The only negative is that there is no restroom inside the lounge. You have to walk a bit far down the hall to reach the nearest toilet.,lounge
844,I found the lounge very comfortable. Enough space for everyone although it was a Friday before a bank holiday weekend. The choice of hot food is limited but appropriate. Used plates and glasses are promptly removed by the staff who are polite and assist requests promptly. I didn't use the showers but the Elemis receptionist went out of her way and gave me her unused personal Elemis lip saver although these products were not generally available to passengers. BA should improve the magazines selection.,lounge
845,The new club lounge at T3 is very nice large and spacious with different seating areas. There was a large selection of both hot and cold food. The red and white wines are in different seating areas which is slightly strange and champagne is only available if you ask. The staff were attentive and customer service could not be faulted.,lounge
846,Great improvement on the old lounge. Quite small but well appointed. The First restaurant excellent - although we were the only two customers - with service both efficient and attentive. Bit of a walk to get there from the underpass walkway however although if you're not in a desperate hurry it's no real problem. As usual this comes at the end of a mass of confusion and waiting for security even in the Premium queue.,lounge
847,The choice of food for our three hour time here was between mini pizzas and croissants which you could then warm up in a none too clean microwave. Choice of drinks was also very limited - we nabbed the last three cans of diet coke in the lounge. Coffee was instant and made with lukewarm water from a flask by a member of staff. Egyptair is a dry airline and so is its lounge. This lounge in terminal one is situated on a balcony but otherwise open to the rest of the airport so noise and so forth a problem. Seating was reasonably comfortable but old and worn. Staff were chatting to themselves except for the toilet attendants who were intent on making you pay for the privilege of using the loos.,lounge
848,I recently waited out a long delay (6 hours) at the Sky Club in Terminal 2 at JFK. Overall this is a spacious lounge with a mix of seating areas (TV lounge bar workstations etc). While the lounge was busy it never felt overly packed. The staff were efficient and drink menu was extensive but as is common with Sky Clubs the food selection was limited to light snacks. One desk agent provided excellent service when my flight was cancelled and worked to minimize the disruption and provide me with options. Given the overall poor state of Terminal 2 it was much less stressful to out the delay in the club rather than in the general boarding area.,lounge
849,This is a very busy lounge. The worst part (other than there's practically no snacks) is that the Men's room is an absolute disaster / pig stye / complete mess no matter the time or day of the week that you visit. On top of this the 'free' T-mobile internet service may as well be nothing at all. It is beyond slow probably worse than 512k dial up. Why?,lounge
850,"This is the new improved lounge and is for those entitled to ""First Class"" privileges but not travelling First Class I was travelling domestically so this was why I used this lounge. Seriously this is the best BA can come up with after how many years. I asked for the restaurant and was shown the buffet. The lounge was nice even allowing for the fact that it was hot in some areas and cool in others. Showers were basic. Staff friendly and helpful. Not worth the effort to try it out.",lounge
851,Had a longish layover due to BA delay and resulting re-booking so decided to use one of the cabanas. These are hotel-style rooms with day bed TV and music and a private bath. Had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice. Then I discovered that the room only had one temperature - freezing cold Also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises. Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times. Restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard. Service can be inconsistent. For an exclusively First Class lounge this could be better.,lounge
852,The new Sky Club at Seatac is a huge improvement over the previous overcrowded club. There is much more space so that it's not teeming with travelers late morning and midday when a number of flights to Asia leave. Excellent facilities for laptops and charging devices. There's a good bar with a number of premium (and pricey) selections - you can still get the house selections at no charge. The snack selection is minimal. Sky Club staff are friendly efficient and helpful as they were in the old club. There's a good view of Mount Rainier out the window - on a clear day.,lounge
853,Delta SkyClub at CVG is one of the nicer ones. The club is large and conveniently located for transferring passengers. It offers a mix of seating types a large window that offers views of the field. The staff were quite friendly. In many ways this club is nicer than many of those at ATL and other Delta hub cities.,lounge
854,I recently spent approximately 90 minutes in the PDX Sky Club prior to boarding a red-eye flight to ATL. Overall the PDX club was fine. It was of a decent size with a mix of seating areas and types (TV lounge quiet areas bar etc.). The only negative was that the club was lightly staffed (one agent and one bar attendant) and both staffers clearly were looking to hustle people out of the club and close up for the night; in fact the bar attendant spent most of her time away from the bar. The club had a decent number of people waiting in it but it didn't feel crowded. Also the club only has one TV which means that people have a choice of just one program.,lounge
855,Mediocre like everything else on El Al. The lounge is okay but kind of run down. The food is okay but not great. The staff is polite but not welcoming.  The bottom line is that I would never pay to use the El Al lounge at either JFK or TLV. If the ticket is free then go ahead.,lounge
856,I recently read a review on this website regarding the Terrace lounge facilities at Jersey airport and was shocked to find it had deteriorated even further from the original submission. Food and dirty plates had been left out for many hours stained carpets and a poorly stocked bar compounded by a member of staff deciding to leave the lounge at 8 pm half an hour before the last flight was due to depart. Passengers had no idea it had incurred a delay and our only source of information came from data streams located on TV’s 100m away from the lounge. Simply terrible British Airways I would recommend that anyone flying Business class from Jersey attempts to spend as much time away from the lounge as you will only be disappointed with the service.,lounge
857,Club Europe Lounge at Gatwick is very nice. It is on two floors and very spacious. The food selection is simple (only sandwiches pasta salads and similar and cheese with biscuits) plus the usual snacks. The only hot food served is soup. Very good selection of drinks with champagne on request very good selection of newspapers and magazines. IT workstations worked very well and are very modern. The toilet facilities are good with excellent showers and you can ask for Elemis products. The only downside was the lack of atmosphere. The lounge is very quite and with no music played in the background it could have been very boring.,lounge
858,Small but fine for the number of travellers on the day. Good atmosphere. Standard of food and drink good but range limited in comparison to say Galleries. so scores down a little.,lounge
859,The style of this lounge is in a Southern plantation setting. I found it clean neat and well kept up. There was no trash sitting around waiting to be picked up on the tables. Kids area was a nice area with a lot of choices for them to pick from. The problem with this and other Delta lounges the food selection is very poor. Tailmix cookies and fruit can only go so far.,lounge
860,I have to agree - reception desk is neither inviting nor friendly. We had a miserable experience checking in with Laura - she was rude completely unhelpful and frankly dismissive. I have never in my life experienced that level of unfriendly customer service - anywhere! Naturally I asked to speak to her manager. She called her manager on the phone spoke to him and then reported to me that he didn't want to talk to me - he was too busy. And then she hung up the phone. Fortunately a Delta representative happened to walk by and we were able to flag her down and she immediately helped us and we were settled into the lounge. We let her know how rude the reception is at the front and yes we called out Laura specifically. I thought it was so weird that upon seeing our displeasure with her service that Laura never apologized that her manager didn't want to speak to us and that in the end it was a Delta rep and not a Sky Team rep who ended up assisting us and providing customer service. I have sent a letter to Sky Team and Delta to tell them about the experience and to reiterate that the front desk needs customer service training and possibly better management - clearly there isn't much supervision going on up front.,lounge
861,Clean and spacious lounge with a very large food selection. Furthermore shower facilities (not used by me) and even spa facilities (again - not used by me). Computer terminals good view onto the tarmac. Lounge has a large number of El Al staff members on duty which are all eager to help. Much better then the Dan lounge which is used by other airlines in Tel Aviv.,lounge
862,"The new Terminal 3 has a large well-appointed King David Lounge in addition to the tired and overcrowded Dan Lounge. (Anybody with a gold credit card can get access to the Dan lounge - regardless of service class.) King David access is restricted to El Al passengers in business class (there is a separate First Class lounge I cannot vouch for) or to members of the King David Club (El Al's upper-tier frequent flyer program also available for an annual fee). I have a King David pass from work and use the lounge whenever I fly out. It is located at the beginning of the ""D"" concourse to your left - the four concourses are four compass points on the central atrium. There is good food available in the Mediterranean style (kosher dairy and parve) - as well as cakes espresso machines soft drinks. Many seats have power outlets next to them (make sure you have a Euro/Israeli 2-prong plug or adapter) as well as Ethernet ports. There's an upstairs deck if it's too crowded downstairs which also offers workstations with PCs (in case you didn't bring your own laptop) as well as a branch of Carmel Forest Spa (no experience cannot comment). There is also a business center downstairs as well as a service desk. Design is pretty nifty. I haven't seen a huge selection of alcoholic beverages but I'm not much of a drinker so it doesn't bother me. Coffee is as good as can be expected from automated espresso machines.",lounge
863,Only food available was cheese and crackers. A waitress eventually appeared but did not approach anyone - she had to be asked for drinks. She brought them through and was never seen again. The room is fully enclosed and looks out on the seating area in the departure lounge - before security. The decor is drab a few magazines to read as well as some out of date newspapers. Couldn't wait to get on the plane. Shame as it soured the end of our holiday slightly.,lounge
864,Pretty busy lounge with good wifi and announcement when new UK newspapers arrived. Alcoholic drinks only available through a servery with occasional missing staff and therefore short queues and delays. Pleasant and efficient staff.,lounge
865,Small lounge it was hard to find a seat. No real meal choices difficult to get something to drink as the bar tender was always leaving the bar. Everything seemed quite dirty. Staff uninterested they send passengers for the Air France flight to Paris one hour to early to the gate. Not really a nice place.,lounge
866,The lounge is located in the satellite building next to gate 18. Very convenient for the gates. The welcome was a little rehearsed and not particularly friendly (but not unfriendly). The lounge is medium size but during my visit very busy. Available food was nuts shrink wrapped cheese and some carrot sticks. Drinks available from a server with a rather stern attitude. I had a G&T but it looked well stocked (although the tonic was from one of those awful fizzy drink guns). The seat was dirty and the rest of the lounge felt grubby warm and crowded. There were high tables to sit at and plenty of power outlets throughout. There's one hour free wireless in the airport. Not sure if there is free wireless in the lounge. Overall I was disappointed but have been to worse lounges.,lounge
867,I found this lounge to be characterless and a little unfriendly. The toilets were filthy but the rest of the lounge was clean. Plenty of seating - watch out for the dangling lights I saw one man hit his head very hard when getting up from his seat. I was there early in the morning and breakfast was available - average nothing special. Alcohol was not available in the lounge until after 10am (my flight was at 9:30!).,lounge
868,Dan Lounge is the ONLY lounge at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv regardless of carrier! The lounge is always packed and with Israeli backpackers and whole extended families that are clearly not traveling in First or Business Class! I think they have some kind of deal with a credit card company or something which allows easy access to the airports ONLY lounge. It only has two toilet cubicles that are unisex and one was out of order so men women and children all had to line up to use the one cubicle! The cold food and beverage table seemed more like a school lunch line with children and youth grabbing things and small children playing with the espresso machine. Last but not least airport staff and airline maintenance and ground crew come through to grab food and drinks laid out for the passengers. I witnessed an aircraft maintenance guy come through a back door and with his clearly dirty fingers and overalls finger several pieces of cake till he found one in the middle he liked stuffed it in his mouth leaving the others aside and walked out the same way he came in! Ben Gurion need to open several lounges to meet the need of its passengers and levels and status. Truly the worst airport lounge I've been in. Really disappointing since the new terminal 3 is so nice!,lounge
869,The 4Deck Lounge was remarkably easy to find. It was somewhat crowded the morning I visited - a nice selection of cheese crackers drinks etc. My disappointment was the inability to connect to wifi and limited tools available on the lounge computers. The host tried to connect me to wifi without success.,lounge
870,Delta Sky Club system in Terminal E has 2 clubs. Both have some snacks soft drinks bad coffee and lots of booze. According to the advertisements Delta is now a world class airline. If these lounges are any indication Delta is a poster boy for how not to be a world class airline. There are no showers no tooth brushes no changing rooms no food except snacks no fruit juices no computers and no telephones. It seems that all you have is what you can bring with you. I'm not comparing Delta to airlines such as Singapore British Airways and Korean lounges which are great but to US carrier lounges which far surpass the Delta product.,lounge
871,I went to several Sky Club lounges (MSP MSY RDU) and they are adequate. They do not offer much in the way of food but not bad if your flight is delayed. There is free wifi in all the lounges and even computer use for those not traveling with their own. The one I entered in terminal E at ATL was really not good. It was the old style (not renovated like many are now) quite large but very crowded. There were numerous children in there! Staff behind the bar were unprofessional and talking about inter-lounge politics and not attentive to staff and the bathrooms were dirty and locks didn't lock properly. It's just slightly better than being in the general boarding area.,lounge
872,"Either I've become spoiled by (even domestic lounges) lounges in other countries and of other airlines or Delta has set a low bar. Coffee is a ready mix type machine and taste as such. A simple drip machine from Target would serve a much better product. The food selection well there was none. Yogurt some granola and not a bowl insight to put it in. The rest was cookie/biscuit type snacks. If alcohol were a staple of any sort one would be in luck. Plenty of booze and beer. Get a clue Delta! You are supposedly a ""World Class"" airline now.",lounge
873,Personnel are very pleasant but the facility is grossly overcrowded. Before the purchase of Northwest Delta had its lounge (larger and more comfortable) in the B Concourse. Now that lounge has closed and Sky Club operates in the South Satellite. There are just too many passengers on too many international flights that all seem to leave within an hour or so of each other.,lounge
874,"We were returning to Glasgow from Langkawi via Kuala Lumpur and Dubai, and had 6 hours in KL so we decided to go to the Lounge. I was only allowed for one extra guest to the lounge but they let me take my two kids as well. Some great food, and array of drinks, tea, coffee, beers and soft drinks. There was a great window to see aircraft and there was good wifi. There were many computers. There were no Sofas. ",lounge
875,"I have used Emirates lounges around the world and this is one of the best. It's just the right size to hold a full A380's worth of First and Business passengers without looking overcrowded. The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices, desserts and lots of good French cheeses. There's the usual self service bar, fridges full of soft drinks and freshly squeezed juices, champagne and wine and a good coffee machine. There's plenty of comfortable seating and a nice observation deck outside where you can stand and watch the A380 arrive and park up right outside. it has a good business centre and nice bathrooms with showers. Overall a very nice and relaxing environment.",lounge
876,"This is the best Emirates Lounge I've used mainly because the food is so good but it's also a very nice, relaxing environment to wait before your 8 hour flight back to Dubai. The first time I used it I checked in at 7pm for a midnight flight so spent several hours there. The second time not so long but on both occasions we had an excellent 3 course restaurant standard meal with lots of good, Far Eastern and European choices which were constantly replenished by the busy staff. There's 2 self service bar areas with good aged spirits, mixers, wine and champagne and a good coffee machine. After dinner we relaxed in the comfy chairs and passed the time with a few drinks, magazines and newspapers. There's a good business centre, free wifi and bathrooms with showers. Overall Excellent, well done Emirates.",lounge
877,"I have transited Dubai many times on Emirates who use Terminal 3 which is broken down into Concourse A/B/C. I have used all 3 Business lounges and A is by far the best as it's new. C is old and tired and B is under renovation so avoid, if you have a long layover take the short train ride to A. The Business Lounge in A is massive and runs the whole length of the building with several food areas, seating areas, bathrooms with showers, business centres etc. The beauty of this lounge is that it has a proper smoking lounge with good ventilation so as a non smoker traveling with a smoker I don't mind going in. It's a proper bar with chesterfield sofas and TV's on the walls, not just a smoke room. In the food areas there's a hot buffet and lots of cold choices, fruit, yogurts etc. Plenty of drinks options and coffee machines that make a very nice macchiato. A is also the A380 terminal so has the 2 deck air bridges and you board directly from the lounge. A is a 10 but I've given 8/10 due to the other 2 lounges.",lounge
878,"I often use this lounge as I have the Emirates Gold card so get a lounge invitation regardless what class I'm flying in. It's typical of most Emirates lounges as they all have the same decor and furniture although this one is quite small when compared to Heathrow. There's always 2 staff in Emirates uniform at check-in who are always warm and friendly and will explain everything if it's your first time. There's comfortable seating with little coffee tables to your left with a big TV and the dining area and self service bar is on the right. And I mean self service, there's no annoying staff who try to pour your drink for you. I've never had a bad meal here, the food is always excellent with plenty of choice. There's a hot buffet and always a soup and a chiller with cold starters, deserts and cheeses. They have 2 self service bar areas with a good choice of spirits, wine and champagne and fridges full of mixers, beers and water, a good coffee machine and lots of tea choices. There's the usual business area with computers and a printer and there's nice bathrooms with showers. The only negative is there's virtually no mobile phone signal.",lounge
879,"The Emirates Lounge in Delhi is awesome and massive, there's only 4 Emirates flights to Dubai per day, all at least 5 hours apart so I'm not sure why this lounge is so big, however my son and I enjoyed it on our stopover from Kathmandu to London via Dubai especially after the nightmare of the transit gates in Delhi! The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices. There's a self service bar with a good choice of spirits, mixers, beers, wine and champagne plus a good coffee machine and teas. You get well looked after on Emirates. After dinner we found another self service bar at the far end of the lounge which we had virtually to ourselves. There's more than enough comfortable seating all around. There's a good business centre and bathrooms with showers. The only negative it was too warm, the air con wasn't cool enough. Overall a nice haven from the chaos outside.",lounge
880,It is a common lounge for many airlines oprating from Lagos. Seating is not too comfortable. During peak hours even getting a place to sit is difficult. Food and drink availabilty is Ok. Service quality is poor. Better place to spend time waiting for boarding as other waiting areas at Lagos Airport is horrible.,lounge
881,We got to the lounge at 4.30 am. It was pretty busy. We decided to have a shower after long flight. We were very lucky because the showers were free. In 1 hour the lounge was packed which is not too bad because it's such a big and spacious lounge. HOWEVER there are 3 blocks of male toilets and only 1 block of female toilets which I found unacceptable! They are doing refurbishments so I just hope there will be more female toilets in very near future. There were queues for female toilets and showers. The demand is absolutely not met for female passengers.,lounge
882,Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from 4 slices of cheese on 3 plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help! No announcements in English - fine for me but not so great for those who don't speak either Arabic or rapid French. Really poor!,lounge
883,This was a very sorry excuse for a business lounge. Far too small and a poor selection of food and beverage. Maybe more time should have been spent on practical chairs and space than on decor!,lounge
884,The lounge is a joke. It is small hence there is little chance of getting a table to yourself. I don't eat meat and I had the choice of rice lukewarm polenta bread crackers cheese salad and fruit. Pitiful. No Baileys.,lounge
885,At 7.30am this huge lounge was impossibly crowded with long queues for the toilets - and even to get a cup of coffee. It was difficult to find a comfortable seat and the food was unappetising. We had 2½ hours turnaround between flights - nowhere near enough in an airport of this size long walks between gates and with long queues for security as well. We wanted a quiet relaxing break breakfast and shower after long flights from New Zealand. No chance - the experience was uncomfortable and stressful. No chance of a shower either - more long queues - facilities totally inadequate for an airport of this size.,lounge
886,After a long flight from Sydney I had 2 hours in the Emirates lounge concourse B before my connecting flight to Brussels. A nightmare! I spent the entire 2 hours with 10-15 other tired men waiting in queue to take a shower. The lounge is huge and crowded not the kind of place where you can relax and unwind. This is clearly the chink in Emirates armor. They should make separate lounges for business class and for silvers. Next time star alliance. Writing this whilst still waiting for a shower. Must have seen at least 40 persons come and leave shaking their head when they saw the queue. Lots of staff around but what's the point when the only thing they can do is ask to see your boarding pass over and over again.,lounge
887,This lounge is not operated by Emirates but it is the one they give access to. It is terrible. Full with passengers from multiple airlines. The food is not fresh and is cup noodle based cheap and tasteless. There is no power point the drinks are from cans and the staff couldn't care less. Emirates change lounge!,lounge
888,Excellent lounge for a smaller airport fantastic range of food and Beverages and attentive and courteous service. Good business centre in the lounge easy to access wifi.,lounge
889,Okay it has not the standard of the Emirates Lounges but I was satisfied. Indian food indian drinks friendly staff. Nice view to the airfield airconditioning. (not standard in India),lounge
890,Had a 10 hr stop over on the outward trip to Perth sat in the A lounge for half the time service not at all friendly food average noticed there were two shower rooms both had 4 people waiting to use them gave up after a while and went to the hotel out of the lounge and used their showers at least they had 10 rooms although it was $15 was well worth it. Eventually was told on the 8th hour there was a B lounge closer to my departure gate not at all easy to find signs up in the air with arrows pointing every where more relaxer chairs needed and more customer friendly staff needed. On the return trip with a 2hr stop over showers still over crowded. Emirates need to address this shortfall before they lose clients to other airlines,lounge
891,A small and overcrowded lounge there were 2 flights leaving at around the same time so the lounge was packed with not enough seats for all. Food and drinks OK but nothing special. Emirates need to seriously consider increasing the size of this lounge.,lounge
892,A spacious and well maintained lounge good choice of drinks and hot food recommended. Ground staff not so friendly but all other aspects positive . Free Wifi throughout the lounge. Location of the lounge not obvious have to follow the signs which are not so clear.,lounge
893,A relatively new lounge and a VAST improvement on the previous offering at Glasgow. Typical Emirates decor but very light and open. Staff at the reception desk were welcoming and took the time to give a personal tour of the lounge facilities to first time visitors. Seating gave a high level of privacy if required as well as more communal seating arrangements. Food and drink selection excellent and staff were attentive to ensuring the were replaced or topped up regularly. Business area was well sited and conducive to getting urgent work matters tidied up before boarding.,lounge
894,Common lounge for multiple airlines. Space is cramped. Seating arrangement is average. Food & Beverages are available but service is poor. Wifi connectivity OK. The place is better than the open waiting area of Lagos Airport where even the basic airconditiong not available.,lounge
895,A great place to relax. The selection of food and drink is very good as is service from staff. It is very close to the boarding gate that Emirates there is a separate gate for Business class passengers From the Chauffeur drop off to the lounge took approx. 15 minutes,lounge
896,My first experience of the First Class Lounge in Dubai and I was not impressed. It was very impersonal and I was disappointed. The only marked difference from the Business Lounges was that it was Table served for Dining. The offerings were nothing special either. I was absolutely appalled to find a large open Smoking area adjoining the Dining Room with dreadful tobacco smells drifting right through. Very Poor indeed. Frankly I would prefer the Business Lounges at Dubai and would certainly not pay the money to use First again.,lounge
897,Enough space and seating arrangement for the guests. Good place to relax before boarding with good choice of food & beverages. Staff assists with the boarding time. Overall a good place to spend time at Delhi T3.,lounge
898,This lounge hardly qualifies as a lounge at all. It has no shower facilities it's sparsely furnished in a very stark environment that resembles a doctors surgery. No dedicated wireless ( you have to access the Logan airport free wifi and keep logging in when it locks you out). Frankly you would be better off hanging out in the general concourse which is what we ended up doing. The so called lounge is in the Jet Blue terminal which is a budget type US airline and the lounge resembles a budget type lounge. Certainly not what one would expect from an airline like Emirates. At the risk of sounding like a snob when one travels business class you expect certain things in a lounge. For anyone who has visited the Qantas lounge in Karratha airport (regional airport in NW Australia) expect a slightly lower standard and that Emirates Boston Logan Airport. This lounge lets Emirates reputation down big time.,lounge
899,This has to be the biggest let down of the Emirates experience . I was in the older terminal as I was flying on a 777 and the lounge is terrible. Breakfast of cold toast lined up in baskets and who knows how long it has been sitting there. Showers - there are only a few for the couple of hundred passengers and there was no cold water only hot. Toilets the same three men's cubicles so a line was the order of the day. Lastly they have a smoking area that leaks smoke to the general area. Having flown through JFK LAX SYD HKG KUL SIN LHR in the last 4 months on a variety of carriers this lounge gets the worst award. Emirates needs some serious work here on the basics.,lounge
900,Superb lounge. Friendly attentive and helpful staff spotless amenities great selection of meals snacks and drinks wifi access and computer stations. Couldn't ask for anything better,lounge
901,Packed and only mediocre service and food. Actually there is a better service and atmosphere outside in the ordinary restaurant and sitting in the main airport departure hall.,lounge
902,The lounge for Emirates is good but can be better. The food is always excellent as well as the good view of the airport. The Wi-Fi is at an acceptable speed and there were sockets everywhere where you can plug in your device to charge. The beverages were amazing coffee juice and water. Apart from sockets there were a lot of seats and tables as well as (2) fountains. Quite disappointed that there wasn't any lie-flat seats.,lounge
903,My experience was great. Arrived at 1.30 AM from Dammam. No crowds had an excellent 4 hour sleep in one of the quiet lounges on one of the beds. I had a shower no queues. Showers clean warm/hot water well ventilated and everything provided. WiFi access easy and speed was good. Food and service excellent and enough seating till my flight to Brisbane departed at 10.30 AM. Bottom line a very good lounge to have a 9 hour layover.,lounge
904,Had a 20 hour stop over in Dubai so plenty of time to sample several lounges. From previous poor experiences of the lounges I checked into the transit hotel- which was excellent. On this occasion the lounges were almost empty - probably due to Ramadan- and the staff outnumbered passengers. It almost made the lounges pleasant- but not quite. The only really good thing about the lounges are the staff in the lounge (and I exclude the reception staff who check you in).,lounge
905,Welcome is sometimes friendly but not always. Nice view of airport apron. Plenty of drinks served at bar but this can create a queue of waiting customers. Food choice not great. Wifi works well and showers and toilets available. This place is still better then just waiting in airport bar before boarding your plane.,lounge
906,Same feeling and look as rest of this airport. Old scrummy over crowded lounge. Bad seating and poorly working wifi. Dirty toilets have not noticed if they have showers. Food quality average and drinks serve your self to the plastic cups. Tasteless coffee and this for a country growing it own and having a coffee culture. Entering the lounge one of these other things that should be taken care of as verry messy. All be it still better to stay in this lounge and drink lousy coffee for free then having to pay 6 usd cash only for a very poor espresso in airport coffee shop.,lounge
907,Lounge has been remade and upgraded ab 6 months ago. Lounge looks already now as if needs another remake . Food and drinks same as before  nothing special to even very boring  end of very poor quality. Food display also with no concern of hygiene. Reception in lounge professional and fast if no passenger in front of you negotiating the price he has to pay or points he has the submit on one of his credit cards to be able to enter the lounge.,lounge
908,I loved the fact that it was quiet no announcements clean nice food selection. I did prefer the Sydney Emirates lounge.,lounge
909,Rather crowded but offering a good selection of food at breakfast time. It was good to get away from the hell that is the shopping area. However the continual extremely loud flight announcements really bothered us. Surely in this day and age Business class travellers can rely on the excellent flight info available on the screens in the lounge. This repeated noise ruined our experience and prevented us from relaxing before our next flight. The toilet facilities also seemed to be insufficient.,lounge
910,The lounge is easy to find. When you come up from the arrivals to the second floor there is a big sign advertising Cloud Nine. Staff friendly and make announcements for departing flights. Wifi connection worked fine once you get the password. There is a paucity of magazines. This lounge main problem is overcrowding and cleanliness of the bathrooms. There is water all over the bathroom floor and unlike EBB's Karibuni Lounge there did not appear to be an attendant who would clean and/or mop the bathrooms at regular intervals. Didn't try the food so no comment. The lounge has an open ceiling so one can hear all the commotion and noise from the main terminal building. I thought lounges are supposed to be oasis of calm. Despite all its faults the lounge is a better alternative than using facilities in the terminal building.,lounge
911,Old seats from many years ago. Food choice ok all served on disposable plates with plastic knives and forks. Drinks - beer soft drinks and coffee. Lounge has no wifi one tv and is not really clean but better then having no lounge access. Lounge should improve even if it was only by providing free wifi.,lounge
912,Severely overcrowded: not a seat to be had. Apparently a flight to China was leaving about the same time as that to Washington DC as most of the people in the lounge were Chinese. Drinks and food good with a variety of western and Ethiopian dishes. Only three computers always busy.,lounge
913,The cleanliness of the lounge and the toilets let down the Emirates experience. The reception staff x 3 did nothing except chat to them selves and left the customer area tables full of clutter. Surprised at this standard.,lounge
914,Not easy to find despite printed instructions handed out at the check-in. Small and clean with comfortable cushioned arm-chairs but few facilities beyond coffee and snacks. Clearly a waiting room not a transit lounge.,lounge
915,An absolute joke! Cannot understand how Emirates can be associated with such a lounge. It is just a cordoned off area in the main departure lounge. The lounge was dirty and in desperate need of a major overhaul. The food was appalling with very poor choice. Not sure if the reason for my sickness in Dubai airport was the result of eating one small sandwich! Available drinks limited to beer colas etc and hot beverages. Wine was available but on payment of approximately £10 for a very small bottle (about a large wine glass). There are no toilet facilities in the lounge. All in all a very disappointing experience especially after great treatment aboard Emirates flights and the lounges at Manchester and Dubai.,lounge
916,Shocking in about every aspect. First of all difficult to find as no signs (it's their hub and both the airport and the airline have the same owner: the Ethiopian government!). Then once found terribly disappointing : no welcome from the staff (they pull faces to everybody entering not very comfortable very mediocre food & wine wifi working but weak and slow. Mind you it is in line with the bad experience in the business class cabin after.,lounge
917,Nice small lounge. I do not know if showers are available . Wifi works fine once you received the password magazines are available all be it not a very large or interesting selection . Booz as much as you want. Food choice interesting and surprising freshly prepacked sushi and salads . Warm soup as a toaster to use your self. Many different kind of instant noodles and some of the other regular stuff. Decent place not perfect but will do.,lounge
918,Lounge was overcrowded; food offerings were poor and looked as though they had been there for a while. There is a lack of seating in the lounge at peak times and for some reason ET have decided to make the lounge nearest the gates a frequent flyer lounge and reserve the rear lounge for business passengers. No signage was given only an abrupt 'no you go to the other lounge'.,lounge
919,Very pleasantly surprised with this lounge. Plenty of room really great friendly staff. I was genuinely shocked by the breakfast food in the lounge - an immense selection and all of very high quality. The poached eggs waiting there were cooked to perfection. Bathrooms very clean with nice hand towels. An absolute standout for a business lounge.,lounge
920,This is better than the Emirates business lounges in Dubai. It is fairly new comfortable clean with polite and helpful staff and excellent catering. I've used it before departures on all of the three daily flights and always found a seat. There are hot and cold buffets (except early morning): the cold buffet is especially good. The kitchen will make food on request; if you want toast and eggs for breakfast they will oblige. As I don't drink alcohol comments and ratings for the drinks are limited the tea coffee water and soft drinks which are all very good. There are only two (men's) shower stalls but they have always both been free and immaculate and the staff supply a hotel style bundle of towels. Plenty of hot water and decent pressure. The only negative point is the wifi. The connection is usually fine but can be a tad slow and difficult to connect at times of high usage.,lounge
921,This is a shared business lounge for most airlines in Dar Es Salaam overall on par with other medium- sized African airports. Large comfortable chairs. Food and drink on par with what you would buy in airport chains. Internet was terrible. Both the Wifi and available computers are so slow many machines will think the internet isn't working. If you can avoid flying through DAR I would : the airport overall is pretty bad.,lounge
922,Large lounge that cannot cope with the volumes of passengers in the mornings. Food offerings included waffles and toasted sandwiches. The food did not look too fresh. Beer soft drinks and spirits on offer. Free wifi. Not enough power points. Toilets were dirty. Not great for a flagship lounge.,lounge
923,Cloud Nine lounge in Addis (Terminal 2) is spacious and excellent food : hot dishes can be dried out which is a big pity. Fresh fruit buffet snacks were so and so. Cake sections impressive. Drinks sufficient. Coffee and tea was excellent. As usual WiFi not working. Very very slow desktops may give you a lifeline to check email but people are at times queuing up to get a seat as there are maximum of 3 computers available. Only 4 power sockets for a lounge to 250 people is very insufficient. Furniture dark heavy and carpets could need a brush up. Toilets are small and insufficient. No shower. The analogue lounge in Terminal is much smaller food and drinks options are much less and no internet. Only one WC. Messy and completely uninteresting better stay outside.,lounge
924,Very small No wine or spirits on offer not a lot of food choice. Toilets outside of the lounge a few minutes walk away. Asked about wine and was told if I wanted it I had to go and buy it not good for someone who is travelling Business Class! Asked for a cup of tea which was produced without any milk asked for the milk none arrived so went back to ask again and the waitress was busy chatting to her friend and then finally acknowledged me.,lounge
925,Great Lounge in new terminal. Seated and services Dining free manicure or massage great showers and RR Drinks selection is out of this world.,lounge
926,Basic shared lounge for a number of airlines. Dial up but free internet slow but better than nothing. Food basic but fine and drink selection OK. Simple overall but better than nothing.,lounge
927,This Lounge for Cloud Nine Passenger of Ethiopian Airlines is not very big but confortable. Good array of Ethiopian Food. Poor selection of Drinks. Toilets are very dirty comparable to a Railway Station. Staff service very poor.,lounge
928,Very nice lounge as stated before this is a large terminal so be prepared to walk. Was there both times at breakfast times and didn't find it crowded nice choice of food wine spirits etc. Toilets and showers were very clean.,lounge
929,Extremely disappointed with the lounge. Overcrowded. Not enough toilet facilities!!! Had to queue. forget about having a shower. Dreadful. Free WiFi did not work. Had to walk a long long way to get to it. Not worth it. Food once found was reasonable. Just far far too many people in the lounge. The worst part of the otherwise good Emirates experience by far.,lounge
930,Shocked at Emirates service at BKK. Checked in 3 hours early looking forward to a superb end to our stay in Thailand. Spent 40 minutes searching for the (closed) lounge. No info from the airline or check in desk. Finally and by accident found it had been relocated to the utterly awful Qantas lounge no explanation just saw an Emirates employee and followed her! What little food was there was cold and inedible. Staff completely disinterested. Soup completely cold and yet butter sachets liquid! Qantas lounge was no better than a 1960s Barnsley railway waiting room. Only in 1964 the food was better and the staff nicer in a British Rail waiting room. Finally negotiated a transfer to another lounge where we mingled with several tattooed gentlemen in singlets and ate some cheese on white bread sandwiches. Well done Emirates! Good customer lost.,lounge
931,"Lounge is small but a pleasant respite while waiting for ones flight. Food choices good, lounge was quiet and not very crowded. The staff were tremendous in keeping travelers informed of their flights, helpful suggestions about the terminal and went out of their way to accommodate travelers requests. ",lounge
932,Good to explore as is huge. Food and bar sensational. Showers a nightmare. Showers downstairs were segregated fair enough but that meant only 4 showers available at any one time and a queue! When I complained I was directed to a in terminal hotel which had showers in a shower lounge. Not easy to find as not well signposted. Otherwise at 8am busy with people but service not affected. 1am again very very busy but access to food wine net was an ease.,lounge
933,This is a large clean and comfortable lounge but the interior feels too open due to the airport terminal's tube-like design. It had many seating areas and was not crowded when I arrived after midnight on March 7. A menu service dining room is available and a few snacks were available near the bar. I would have preferred a buffet meal line as a supplement especially if one is in a hurry. Staff was courteous and meal service was prompt. The business center had many computer terminals and I was the only user at that time. This lounge is not modern with direct gate access like the one in Terminal A but it is a pleasant place to spend a few hours.,lounge
934,The staff were polite and attentive although we were told the staff will personally come to us and remind us when it's time to board the flight - but they forgot.. Food was above average. We ended up boarding the flight as the last pax. Couldn't comment about the shower and business facilities as we didn't use them.,lounge
935,Awful lounge. Don't waste your money. Not only was it empty but when I fell asleep they woke me up saying sleeping was not allowed! After I paid them several hundred dollars! This lounge is very noisy sub par food and service and I would have booked something else if I knew.,lounge
936,A very good lounge and service totally let down by stylish but uncomfortable seats and lack of toilets.,lounge
937,Very nice atmosphere and comfortable enough after I had to tell someone who roared into his phone to go into the closed off business area. I also told staff this should not be allowed and this is their job to look for and sort these issues. It is not the guest who should have to do this. Excellent A la carte table dining (for breakfast anyway). There is a buffet for fruits yogurts etc.,lounge
938,The lounge is located above duty free shopping after the immigration clearance. The lounge is huge the staff didn't bother about giving a quick tour of the lounge as they were pretty busy. The lounge has a resting and a dinning area seats were comfortable but a bit noisy with lots of families with young children. Wide selection of drinks and bar snacks. They were serving lunch so there was soup and good spread of starters and mains. The desserts were excellent too. Overall the lounge was well maintained and comfortable.,lounge
939,Excellent lounge spacious and well laid out. Great selection of food and drinks. This is better than any of Emirates lounges in Dubai.,lounge
940,This was the lounge in the A380 terminal. The staff were faultless food good. Downside was the shower facilities… - slightly warm water (could not get it hot) and very basic (shower not enclosed little power in shower compared to lounges such as Asiana and other airlines). No massage chairs seemed to be available which is a shame. The staff are let down by the facilities which are simply not up to the standard one expects of a new Emirates lounge.,lounge
941,Excellent facilities and first class service. High quality food genuine service and comfortable environment. There appears to be only 1 shower in the ladies room and there is no place to recline while waiting for your flight.,lounge
942,Greeted by a polite well groomed man and directed into lounge with subdued lightening light coloured vinyl tub chairs and low partitions (top 3rd frosted glass). These are showing some signs of wear - quite uncomfortable. In one corner 4 cubicles with back-facing massage chairs and a beaded curtain for privacy. First Class area is the just a cordoned off back corner separated by a sign several plants. Food/beverages well below par. Tea preparation is separate from coffee. Array of teabags you find in any chain hotel room - only milk UHT. Coffee from machine worse than instant and tepid. Arrived at 9pm. Food almost depleted yet to be restocked. Tried a tomato/iceberg lettuce/hummus sandwich but it'd been so long it was in it's plastic bag it'd become soggy and the bread curled. Signs indicate hot vegetarian options where carrot soup and mashed potato. Several hot stew looking dishes and several Asian options. Six pcs with good internet speed. Along the entire window length a row of desks with individual reading lamps. Hospitality staff are pleasant. Female toilets: 2 cubicles 2 showers 2 hairdryers. Soap dispensers are the plastic type you buy in a supermarket. Extremely disappointing! I'm popping downstairs to grab a bite to eat.,lounge
943,What a contrast to the terminal 1 lounge last July and the new lounge in Terminal 3 by gate 35. The new lounge is spacious high quality furnishings great bar plentiful supply of food. Only negative is that it appears to be quite focused on Indian hot foods. Staff very attentive didn't use the spa. I guess the previous reviewer is a 1st class customer and would expect a separate lounge other airlines. A huge improvement and is matched to the excellent lounge in Dublin. On Etihad you normally get redemption seats which you never get any more with Emirates.,lounge
944,This is the only part of Dubai airport which is worth visiting. The lounge is comfortable there was a very wide selection of good hot and cold food drinks etc. I would be happy to revisit this place if I ever return to Dubai - but that isn't going to happen - one visit to Dubai is enough for anyone.,lounge
945,Brisbane's Emirates lounge is pretty decent. We arrived late from Singapore en-route to Auckland. We had eight hours to catch our flight to Auckland so we decided to get comfy at the lounge. We were welcomed at the reception given a tour of the lounge and recommended a cozy corner to sleep. There were four showers well stocked with timeless spa products. After a morning shower we had a light breakfast. Internet speed was fine. The best part about the lounge is that you can board your A380 from the lounge itself.,lounge
946,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet. It is a huge lounge because it covers the whole building.,lounge
947,Etihad have closed their existing business and First lounges in Terminal 3 and opened a new combined lounge (no separate First) near Gate 35 in Terminal 3. First impressions were that this is a high- quality lounge spacious and a lot more capacity than the existing lounge. Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for 65 minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here. I believe that when they renovate the old lounge area near the shops it will be a dedicated First lounge which will hopefully take the pressure off in this lounge. Poor experience overall.,lounge
948,Terminal 3: Arrived in 'Business' lounge at 0015. Every seat was occupied. Busier than a bus terminal and about as comfortable. Screaming children added to the misery. The lounge is way too small to seat the people paying a big premium for their ticket. Other bleary-eyed travellers were circling the lounge looking for seats constantly. Shag-pile carpet looks dirty couches worn and grubby. Unsatisfactory.,lounge
949,The moment I walked in I could see it was crowded big time and it was hard to find a place to sit. It is 1/20th smaller than emirates lounge in Dubai. Food a good spread and very efficient staff. Quiet room spacious but sleeping on couch is always painful for a tall guy. Washrooms cramped to the core and very small.,lounge
950,This is a poor lounge. The environment is out if date and the snack offering is cellophane prepacked stuff.,lounge
951,A very nice lounge to use with good staff service. Excellent fillet steak followed by tart citron cheese biscuits and coffee. Perfect to eat there as it is a late evening departure.,lounge
952,Generally I fly with Singapore Airlines and now I know why. The business lounge although enormous was missing decent toilet and shower amenities. That is a huge disappointment and something you expect when flying business. The toilets were dirty and extremely run down. The showers were horrible and that's if you could be bothered waiting in line to use them. Completely disappointed by the new terminal business lounge.,lounge
953,We did this lounge in Jan 2014 EY418 to KUL. One of the worst I ever been in space wise. I had to give my stool to a furlorn standing lass with a cup of coffee in her hand. My first on Etihad and what a disappointment for the hub airport. The lounge was so overcrowded. Will be travelling J again as Etihad are value for bucks but shall be researching for a alternative airport paid lounge for a convenient place to sit. Staff were doing the best they could given the incompetence and short sightness of Etihad. What a downer on Etihad offerings.,lounge
954,Abu Dhabi Lounge Terminal 3. From the moment you get the lift/stairs to the entrance you feel like a Number. You don't feel special or the dollars you spent on a ticket was worth it. Its too busy Lounge is too small. The spa is brilliant as well as showers. I cannot fault customer service. The biggest problem are size of the lounge way too small. you feel cramped and enclosed. It didn't feel like a Business Class lounge of quality ie: Singapore Emirates Qantas British Airways.,lounge
955,Fantastic service and extremely nice people. Love the food and the care of the lounge staff.,lounge
956,Excellent Lounge. The food court is separated from the main sitting Area. Business center (internet etc) in a separate area. Decoration is a bit austere making the lounge looking like a bank! The men's bathroom was totally run down. One of the faucets had an out of order sign and so had one of the shower rooms. Looking into the shower in operations was totally run down with humidity patches on walls.,lounge
957,This lounge is huge for this little number of passengers of one A380 in Munich. Very clean. A lot of different possibilities to sit or work. In the afternoon they offer a fantastic range of cold and hot food with a great selection of wine and other drinks. Champagne as well.,lounge
958,"Flying Australia to Ireland (or any number of European destinations) means you leave from creaky old terminal 2 when you change in Dubai. The Business Class lounge here is dreadful: shabby overcrowded and noisy. Going the other way you leave from Terminal 3 a new purpose-built A380 terminal. The lounge is almost as long as the terminal - departure gates for Business Class passengers are in the lounge. Not having to trek through the main concourse is a pretty good convenience. I arrived at the busy time just after midnight and left after a long layover at the next busy time just before 10am. In between the lounge was quiet spacious and very comfortable - especially the quiet area with loungers at the far end. (There were no PA announcements to disturb me for six hours as there were no flights). Even at the busy times the lounge wasn't crowded. There are two food service areas a lounge- like space on the left and a restaurant area hidden on the right with proper tables. Food and drink was okay in both areas if not inspiring. If you have a long layover at terminal 2 its worth using this lounge in terminal 3 and give yourself 20 minutes to get to the other terminal by the underground rail shuttle. One warning about Dubai Airport: ""duty free"" is a nonsense concept. The airport is a big shopping mall where everything is vastly overpriced.",lounge
959,This lounge is over crowed. No peace area. Lots of screaming kids. Very limit selection of food and drinks. Atmosphere is a sort of darkish. In general uncomfortable. Not to be recommended.,lounge
960,The food and beverage selection was very extensive with several a la carte items offered. The staff was extremely courteous and eager to please. One employee in particular Nerlita went above and beyond to make sure I was well attended and provided superior customer service. I travel a lot for work and I have had the opportunity to visit many lounges- this one tops the list.,lounge
961,Just relaxing in the Etihad lounge and the service is excellent as usual. The staff are helpful and friendly and nothing seems too much trouble. The quality of the food is amazing and I'd have no hesitation in recommending this lounge to others.,lounge
962,The Business class lounge in Dubai is vast and has a similar feel to a motorway service station. There were plenty of seats available and a decent selection of drinks. A big minus is that there are not enough toilets available for the number of passengers.,lounge
963,This was a great lounge with plenty of food and drink. The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for me.,lounge
964,I use this lounge when departing from Birmingham as I am a Gold Skywards Member. I find this lounge to be an excellent start to any trip with Emirates. It is large spacious and the food on offer is always good. It ranges from snacks to hot or cold main meals with delicious desserts. A very adequate range of drinks is also on offer. The staff are extremely courteous and service is efficient and unobtrusive.,lounge
965,Etihad use the SATS Premier Lounge in T2 at Changi. We had six hours in this lounge and found it to be better than a lot of airline lounges we have used. Greeted by friendly staff at reception. A huge selection of food was available that was well presented and kept fresh. Choices available from the bar were not so extensive. Staff cleared away dishes promptly. Clean washroom facilities. Excellent WiFi.,lounge
966,One of the worst lounges in an airlines hub city you can imagine. The lounge is very small and was packed with people at 11pm  more people were coming in and simply walking out 3 of us eventually found a lounge chair but there was no real reason to be there. The toilets are very limited food selection was average at best and biggest problem is screens showing flights we could only see one which was only giving details in Arabic (even Tehran airport VIP lounge that Etihad uses has screens in two languages). No sign of any TV or other entertainment was in view in the corner we were located The internet was 3rd world standard slow. As we left we noticed they had opened the door to the first class lounge which had not a soul in it. Maybe there are quieter times but this really lets down Etihad's inflight standards.,lounge
967,Due to our 1325 departure the lounge was not as busy as at other times of the day. However seeing this serves Etihad's T3 I can see how it's facilities can be put under pressure. There was no a la carte food offering just a hot/cold buffet. I asked a member of staff if they could make a little something up for our baby daughter and they obliged. In addition my wife asked if there was any dessert wine available (as there is on the plane) there wasn't but the gentleman behind the bar arranged for a glass to be brought through from the First Class lounge. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was very good. Unfortunately the children's room was not up to the standard of Heathrowe. Finally on using the baby change facility (disabled toilet) after washing our hands we discovered we could not dry them because there was no hand towel in the holder or hand dryer or paper towels.,lounge
968,"As an EVA Air Business Class passenger I spent some time at the Aspire Lounge 41 before my flight to Bangkok. The staff were friendly and professional and kept the place very clean. The lounge is very light with large windows overlooking the tarmac. There's a variety of seats including lounge chairs. The food and beverages are ok, but nothing special. I'd like to see some more options in snacks and non-alcoholic beverages like for example a variety of juices. There is a pay for shower available but I didn't use it. WiFi connection was easy and good. Overall it was a comfortable experience, a little improvement on the catering would give it that extra touch.",lounge
969,Very disappointing to be honest. The seating and service from staff was great but like the business class lounge at this airport it was very noisy because the general concourse and duty free area on the floor below is open to both first and business class lounges in the centre and the noise travels up and in. The food was marginally better than the business class lounge but to get toast and butter you had to go into the dining room sit wait to be served and then wait for the toast. All a bit over the top. Toilets and showers were exactly the same as in the business class lounge. Champagne was a little better I was told but the diet coke tasted just the same.,lounge
970,No towels for showers. Food is pre prepared salads and sandwiches. If you are booking a flight out of Rome choose another carrier.,lounge
971,Gate B lounge an extremely busy lounge even at midnight. Due to its design it was hard to see where empty seats were located so literally sat down in the first one I came to which wasn't particularly that comfortable. It was near a bar though and the staff there were very efficient in serving you. Empty glasses/bottles quickly cleared away by the waiting staff. I couldn't see where to get proper food so can't comment on that one. Toilets kept very clean and tidy. Good speed for wifi also. Gate A lounge a much better design/layout than its Gate B counterpart. While still busy there did seem to be a choice of seating available. Easy to see where food was being served and the breakfast items were ample. Staff here seemed to be going for efficiency than friendly. Unfortunately I couldn't get connected to the lounge wifi but managed to get connected to the general airport wifi for 30 precious minutes. Toilets spotlessly clean.,lounge
972,Plenty of space and facilities. We travelled on the 09:15 departure to Abu Dhabi with our seven month old daughter and made use of the (sound-proofed!) children's room. We had the a la carte breakfast and recommend the eggs benedict and pancakes. Hot and cold drinks regularly offered. There was a buffet with all the usual staples. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was a nice touch. Overall one of the better lounges we have used.,lounge
973,We used this lounge when travelling on Air Malta flights. London Heathrow lounge is excellent and in the opinion of my wife and myself is on a par if not better than the BA First Class (Concorde) Lounge at Heathrow T5. On entering the lounge we were given a warm welcome. We were there on a weekday morning between 08.45 to 11.00. There was an excellent breakfast (buffet and a la carte) with almost anything you could want. We found the spa in the to be readily available for chosen treatments. Although there is not a self-service bar for alcoholic drinks in the lounge there is a bar where passengers are served with alcoholic drinks. We have used the lounge twice (both times when travelling Air Malta Business Class) and have found the lounge and staff to be first rate.,lounge
974,Very large lounge but with limited refreshments on offer. Spa closed. Lots of staff cleaning tables but no table service. Soft drinks and beer available in fridges. Free wifi. If you want alcohol there is a small bar at the right hand side of the entrance which is easy to miss but they had no vodka left with no offer to replenish it. Wine served in half a glass. Quite disappointing lounge although it was quiet.,lounge
975,"Very nice Star Alliance lounge at LAX, with outdoor patio that has a fireplace. Ample seating. Nice decor. Available shower rooms. Food selection varies every time I visit but there is one staple: Vietnamese noodle (if you know how to mix it, it's great eats). Other food items were a bit below other international business/frequent flyer lounges. Wifi is available and fast enough to stream video or support VoIP phones. Flight status and current local time displayed in multiple places. Staff welcome at entry, but it be nice if they could smile. I recommend that you arrive earlier to LAX so you can enjoy the lounge.",lounge
976,The lounge is newly refurbished and very modern with some designer blue lighting in thick strips (akin to the starlights lighting on the aircraft) variety of seats including bucket high backs that I used. The lounge was long and thin quite crowded at first which gave the staff a task when many moved on as one leaving a lot of tables looking messy. The drink and food range is fairly standard for this airport - but did add some hot food over the Thai lounge offerings. Nice no problems but not exceptional.,lounge
977,Small lounge with small selection of food and drinks but these are good quality. If you want the packs of Walkers Shortbread biscuits be quick as the Chinese grab these in handfuls and stuff them in their carry-on bags.,lounge
978,I look forwards to visiting the Emirates lounge in Zurich Airport. Long walk but excellent food and wine. Average sized lounge but long trek to find it - however it is near the usual gate. One of the best lounges I have experienced. What a shame that they do not just buy a wifi modem and offer a decent service rather than that provided by the airport.,lounge
979,Emirates Lounge in Hong Kong is small but never seems too crowded. Excellent choice of food hors d'oeuvres etc. Soft drinks beers Champagne wine. And the staff will make up a sandwich for you if you wish. HKG doesn't have fast track for business class. But not a problem. The problem with HKG is the arrival. Didn't check showers or wifi.,lounge
980,Absolutely appalling. Very disappointing to find that Emirates is associated with this lounge. There is hardly any food except a small bowl of salad or a stale sandwich. Is this really the service we expected when choosing business class with one of the so called top airlines of the world? Makes you think about booking Emirates again.,lounge
981,Table service for drinks and hot foods. Waitresses very attentive and polite. Only serving one flight so quite quiet lounge. Small buffet area for mezze cheeses etc. I had cream of celeriac soup with mushrooms and truffle oil! fillet of cod with black olive tapenade root veg purée and vegetables! washed down by several well-topped up glasses of champagne. Restaurant quality in taste quality and service. Own toilets not shared as in the other lounges there. A great start to a holiday indeed. Cannot be faulted.,lounge
982,Accessed as part of Gold card member benefits. The drink choices are high quality (excellent sauvignon blanc) - my only minor gripe would be the starter on the dining menu was slightly below the normal standard but an excellent main and dessert. Fast wifi good selection of papers plenty of seating make this my favourite lounge.,lounge
983,An excellent lounge probably the best for choice and quality of food. Abu Dhabi is the worst very overcrowded limited selection of food but staff good.,lounge
984,We had the opportunity to use the Eva Air lounge in Taipei during a layover to Hong Kong. Eva Air has four lounges here - Star Infinity Garden and the Club. We went into each lounge and ultimately settled in the Star Lounge. Each lounge has its own atmosphere and style. The Star and Infinity lounges are connected with the same reception desk. Plenty of food and drink options are available along with showers in the Star and Infinity lounges. Seating is abundant and comfortable. Wifi is available. I was very impressed with the regular cleaning of the washrooms and lounge. The staff was very friendly and professional.,lounge
985,At first a bit difficult to find. Signs are not well posted within the airport building. The lounge is light and spacious. Ample seating and good reading material. Flight departure announcements are made in the lounge. Catering very good. An excellent selection of Chinese Thai and Western foods. Bathrooms clean. Free internet. Staff are quick at clearing empty plates etc from tables.,lounge
986,Menzies Lounge at Amsterdam is the lounge that EVA Air uses for its business class passengers. This lounge needs a facelift. The seats are old saggy leather ones. Newspapers are creased and wrinkled. Catering is next to nothing. A few triangles of Dutch cheese with crackers and pot noodles that you add hot water to. One white and one red wine and the usual beverages. It lacks atmosphere. It is a real let down.,lounge
987,Business Class lounges in Concourse C - clean luxurious superb service excellent amenities great food wine drinks and juices. The new Business Class Lounge in Concourse A is a mega lounge with several mini-lounges and integrate boarding gates within the mini-lounges. Concourse A is for the use of A380s and has 25 gates. While there is a main dining and lounge area the idea is really to go to the mini-lounge area closest to your gate. Each mini-lounge has a wonderful spread of food drinks coffee machines wines etc. The food is great. Four vegetarian and four non-vegetarian options and salads breads and appetizers. There is a place to take a shower and it has all the amenities. There is also a Timeless Spa [paid I think]. The lounge is designed to seat close to 2000 people.,lounge
988,The best Emirates Lounge that I have visited. Relatively small the staff are welcoming and helpful no matter. A superb selection of drinks and hot and cold food is backed up by efficient clearing of plates and polite staff who make the stay as comfortable as possible.,lounge
989,It seems there is a new lounge under construction in the B terminal. The temporary lounge is a hot mess. It is just a section of the upper floor of the airport that has been blocked off to give a pretence of a lounge. It is loud (constant airport-wide announcements.) hot poor ventilation and messy. The staff are spread out over too large an area and cannot cope with the scope of effort required. Dirty plates cups and tables abound but the seat-hungry business traveler doesn't care and takes any port in a storm. Emirates should have brought on extra staff but chose not to. The staff are friendly but management is asking too too much. The lounge in the A terminal is in good repair and should be used instead of the B terminal. Waiting at the actual gate is more relaxing.,lounge
990,The buffet food choices were more varied and better quality than last visit - thai green curry and chicken in red wine sauce were both very good. For a pay on entry lounge (I access as Etihad guest gold card holder) the drink brands are always good quality - using Johnny Walker Green label as their standard mixing whiskey (something of a waste but not complaining!). The main problems with this lounge is that it does get very busy at peak times and woefully inadequate bathroom facilities. Good wifi newspaper selection and bbc world news on tv.,lounge
991,Shower and toilet can become a nightmare. Just one shower and one toilet. No cleaning between guests no waiting list - if you want to take a shower you'll have to wait in line in the toilets! A nightmare! Wrote several times to Etihad probably others did never saw an improvement. Make sure there are towels before you start!,lounge
992,Visited this lounge on 6 different occasions in last month. It is by far one of the worst I have used. On a number of occasions I had to sit on the floor due to overcrowding. Etihad have two lounges here and both are as bad as each other. There is no booking system for a shower so it can be impossible to get one. Others mention the food as being great - I disagree food on the plane in business class is far better. The staff are good. In my travels with Etihad I would say that their Dublin lounge is the best I have used so far. You can order proper meals there but you cannot at their home lounges.,lounge
993,The lounge was relaxing food was good although they need more western style food. The staff was friendly and the lounge was well lit. Also the lounge was clean and there was usable wifi.,lounge
994,Warm welcome from staff. Very large lounge but somewhat impersonal. Not a lot of western food available. The showers were brilliant kept clean by a nice staff. They were really shower suites with a miniature bedroom attached with wardrobe vanity unit and dressing shelf. A joy to use.,lounge
995,Untidy and in a very poor condition. Very crowded extremely poor selection of drinks and snacks. We just about managed to get a seat together in a cramped windowless corner and had to step over the lead of the lap top for the man next to us every time we got up. The toilets were in a poor condition as were the lounge seats. The staff barely cleaned the tables and seemed more intent on finishing their conversation in the kitchen area. The receptionist didn't even say goodbye when we left. I couldn't find a newspaper or any other reading material. Will not use this lounge again at LHR.,lounge
996,"Sprawling lounge with excellent food and drink but it was crowded even at midnight. Major design flaw in that the designated ""quiet zone"" packed with lounges and beds is the noisiest part of the lounge with very loud announcement speakers and noise from the terminals below. Very difficult to get any sleep in the lounge even after midnight.",lounge
997,A nightmare - a long queue to get in and then - ten minutes queue for the ladies toilet. A big queue for coffee and snack. No free tables/chairs. Used plates everywhere not cleared away. Noise level dreadful. No chance of getting a shower for a couple of hours. If you can avoid.,lounge
998,An excellent lounge with plenty of seating a wide range of good food and reading material free wifi and proximity to gates.,lounge
999,Lounge provided for gold and silver frequent flyers available for other airlines and payment. Small dull normally overcrowded uncomfortable and inadequate toilet facilities.,lounge
1000,Food is great and bar staff are friendly and efficient. The problem is that it is way too small to handle the passenger flow. Can be difficult or near impossible to get a seat. Toilet facilities are very cramped and totally inadequate for the number of passengers they have to handle.,lounge
1001,This is the Air New Zealand lounge shared by Etihad. The staff was vaguely interested the food choice very limited and very very average. There was no shower gel nor shampoo in the showers the shower mixer was broken resulting in nearly boiling water pouring from the shower head. When complained to the head of the staff I heard that how could they no if guests did not report implying there is no cleaning between the guests! All together terrible experience despite very good service on board though. Will not come back again.,lounge
1002,This lounge is a shocker for their home base Eva Air need to do something to improve the standard. Food and drink was pretty poor I had a 36 hour stopover at this airport so I got to know this lounge all too well - if I never go back that will be fine with me.,lounge
1003,It’s much better than the old airport but there are still lot things that they could be improved. For instance food section could do with more selection of hot food and drinks also can be provided with more variety. Massage chairs were great and easy to use as well. Noticed that they have installed a shower but it wasn’t a very high standard one and it looked very shabby and basic . Only got two TV monitors of flight info on both sides if you want to check your flight info you have to walk a little bit to get it as it’s a very long lounge could have installed more TV monitors in the middle.,lounge
1004,All new modern design good selection of food and drinks. Food changes during the day. Away from the other lounges but near EVA boarding gates. Very clean bright and comfortable.,lounge
1005,We used the first class lounge twice recently and one of the best lounge experiences we have had. We had a late night snack of Sushi and drinks outward and a Champagne Breakfast on the return. Both were excellent and served by efficient staff. Boarding was direct from the lounge which was excellent.,lounge
1006,The lounge at Birmingham is quite new and well run with a decent selection of food and drinks. Generally a pleasant and comfortable environment to spend a few hours waiting for your flight.,lounge
1007,My 3rd time but this time everything changed and downgraded. As per previous reviews I was very disappointed with Dubai Business Lounge very overcrowded no hot food meal options only cold buffet snack type foods.,lounge
1008,Very attentive and friendly staff restaurant food plenty of it great wifi and comfortable seating. Showers and bathrooms spotless.,lounge
1009,Used the Etihad Pearl Business Lounge at Abu Dhabi T3 while connecting from a MCT-AUH flight to AUH-MAN in business. Between these two flights the lounge was a huge disappointment particularly with this being Etihad Airways home airport. The lounge was crowded so there were no comfortable seats available the food was okay but lacked choice (four of six hot options were available) - and the toilets were filthy.,lounge
1010,Further to my previous post Sep 2011 this lounge has improved. It's still an awkward walk from T3 to T1 but I was pleasantly surprised how improved the lounge was. There is now a newspaper and magazine rack the food selection now has a lot more to offer including cold cuts of meat and various cheeses. A bigger selection of hot ( warm) dishes various teas and coffees and a lot more seating arrangements ( previously the middle and lower tier sections were closed off ) . The washrooms are a little small but a hot shower is available. A well stocked bar with waiter service is a nice touch. On a minus note there didn't seam to be any computers available. Overall a very pleasant experience and would recommend to all.( shame you still have to walk into T1 for a smoke though).,lounge
1011,The airport lounge is long and narrow but not overcrowded. The business section has internet connection but no computers unlike the EVA lounge in Hong Kong Airport. WiFi is free however. Seats comfortable and lounge is clean. The food is passable but not excellent. I would expect the lounge in EVA's home base to be more elegant.,lounge
1012,EVA Air flies to Newark only three times a week and does not have its own lounge. Its flight departs at 1030 pm and check-in begins three hours earlier. However the business lounge operated by BA only allows EVA passengers to enter after 8:45 pm and attempts at early entry would be stopped by a British Airways staff stating that this is their agreement with EVA. The lounge is small and crowded and can barely accommodate all the EVA passengers. I hope EVA could negotiate with BA to accomplish a better terms of agreement so that passengers could use the lounge at least two hours prior to departure of the plane.,lounge
1013,Crowded and with poor access. Staircase or one very busy elevator. Very limited food but drink options quite ok. Not really anywhere to relax and check in can be too time consuming. Finnair know how to do it properly with their their Non-Schengen lounge. Why they offer this product is strange considering the airline itself continues to improve.,lounge
1014,Shabby crowded poor catering. Overall very disappointed with the complete experience. Showers looked shabby and water was cold on both my outbound sector and inbound.,lounge
1015,What a Dungeon! Never expected this from Emirates. To pay almost 8500K on a ticket and to be thrown in a lounge that has no natural lighting is overcrowded with limited selection of food and drink is disgraceful. One bite of a sandwich that was stale and we packed up and walked out. We felt much better sitting around like randoms in the general airport area.,lounge
1016,"Still a few teething problems but they are trying hard. Signage is difficult to find so everyone has stopped at the first seating area which is packed - while the rest of the lounge is quite empty. Also the constant boarding announcements for flights departing other parts of the airport are bit annoying - they should only announce flights in Concourse A. The lounge ""looks"" great but is a bit style over function. For example tables are difficult to sit and eat at chairs not too comfy.",lounge
1017,In terminal 1 about 10 minutes walking from terminal 3. Have always found this lounge to be clean and less crowded than the actual Etihad business class lounge in terminal 3. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Same food and drinks as in the business lounge.,lounge
1018,"This is the Air New Zealand lounge shared by Etihad. Who on earth decided to use wickerwork rattan armchairs for the ""comfort"" of travellers who sometimes have to spend hours waiting for a connecting flight - the armrests alone are uncomfortable enough but add in the punishment to the seating area penetrating through the cushion. The only other viable seating is of a benching type so no armrests - but on balance preferable! The food choices were very limited and as such I was not hungry enough to assess the quality.",lounge
1019,If you are a silver or gold card holder flying in economy class this lounge is now allocated to you. However this lounge is located in terminal 1 and as most people transit in terminal 3 I don't think it's worth the 20+ minute walk to use what is generally a sub standard facility. I wouldn't pay to use this facility and would rather sit in Starbucks at my own expense.,lounge
1020,EVA has its own lounge within a bigger one shared by a number of other airlines. It was empty when I entered the lounge for my afternoon flight to Taipei. I was greeted by a very charming lady who gave me a menu of light lunch with two or three main courses to choose from. I used the computer which has excellent internet connection. The meal arrived and the girl set the table nearby and the wonton soup I order was excellent. In general an excellent experience.,lounge
1021,Very poor. The selection of food and drink was poor and had evidently not been updated for a long time despite the main flight of the day leaving an hour later and the lounge being little used. Very little sign of the staff and overall a somewhat depressing experience.,lounge
1022,What a poor lounge - for the main hub for an airline you would expect they would make every effort to roll out the red carpet and make it a memorable experience.,lounge
1023,"Spacious, comfortable and relaxing lounge. Reclining chairs with views are pleasant. Food is just ok while the drink options are fine. Very short walk to all non-Schengen gates. So much better than the Schengen lounge it is hard to believe it belongs to the same airline.",lounge
1024,Visited again the lounge on the 28th of November for four hours before a domestic flight. Unfortunately instead of improvements the service had gone worse. No food despite the new space- consuming meal service tables. Not a single copy of the newspapers I normally read there (Herald Tribune Iltasanomat) even though they were sold at general news stands at the boarding area. Waiting lines for the dirty toilets despite the fact that the lounge was half empty. No place to hang one's coat at the toilet (middle one for disabled passengers). A section of the area closed for passengers. Lots of staff but very little service for us frequent flyers. It is a shame that the Finnair 'home base' lounge is like this even though the international lounges are ok.,lounge
1025,Nasi Langsar was cooked on request and a fantastic Malaysian meal prior to boarding. The staff were friendly and extremely professional.,lounge
1026,I agree with other reviewers that the Dubai lounge is poor. It has no ambience and is crowded. We also noticed that people hog seats. We were not hungry and didn't eat much but the food quality seems OK.,lounge
1027,The lounges at Heathrow and Colombo are excellent. At Heathrow boarding is direct from the lounge which is comfortable. The food and drink are excellent. In Colombo the lounge is very relaxing. It has an excellent range of food and drink and service could not be better.,lounge
1028,Whenever I've visited this lounge it's always been overcrowded. Somebody at Etihad has got they're sums wrong. Other than this a good facility.,lounge
1029,Very disappointed by the Lounge and by the lounge staff who were unfriendly and unprofessional. For the food and beverages facilities and the lounge was correct.,lounge
1030,Extremely disappointing. Limited choice of food In fact there were on two varieties of tuna rolls on offer along with corn chips and pretzels. Nothing else. My wife and I were traveling to Sydney and had a four hour layover between connecting flights and while the peace and quiet of the lounge was welcomed the lack of food was not.,lounge
1031,I Visited this lounge when connecting from Asia to a Schengen destination. Access was via stairs with a significant amount of 2way traffic. The frontdesk area was rather congested as was the food and drink area. It was very crowded so to leisurely pick a food and drink choice with also carry-on luggage to worry about was no option and therefore I settled for some orange juice. That as such was fine for me: I don't visit a lounge for food and drinks anyway (as there is decent food on the business class flight that follows) but I do visit a lounge for some peace and quiet and since there where very few comfortable seats left but an awful lot of traffic instead there wasn't much chance. Also too few facilities in the men's room also here was a small queue forming. I must add however that this was my 1st and only visit to this lounge and the time of day may have been a factor (around 15:30 local time) so it may be better at a different time of day. But in my opinion it is not capable to sufficiently cope with the amount of visitors that I saw during my visit.,lounge
1032,While connecting from Amsterdam on a flight to Asia I had plenty of opportunity to wait in this lounge and I can say it was very comfortable. Food and wine selection was more than sufficient as was the seating capacity. But what I personally enjoyed the most were the wonderful recliner seats with a nice view over the apron.,lounge
1033,The lounge was closed for three months for a renovation without alternative service or compensation for number of Finnair frequent flyers (Silver card holders). After the renovation the standards have unfortunately dropped in a significant way. The two main problems are: Instead of two access routes only one is left (one set of stairs and one elevator frequently reserved for maintenance purposes). As a result long waiting lines to the lower floor delay and frustrate customers. People have to stand on the stairs for up to 15 minutes to check in. The meal & snacks area has become too congested preventing access to the food and drinks for both the customers and the staff. As a result you grab what you can or what happens to be left while trying to avoid stepping on too many toes. The staff struggles to keep the area clean and organized for the same reasons. Add boring selection in regard to hot food and salads (well everything; no changes for years) in particular from the viewpoint of most frequent visitors the supposed priority for the airline. Overall I miss the lounge as it was before the renovation. Whatever goal the renovation served remains a mystery unless the idea was to make it less attractive?,lounge
1034,Had to wait 5hrs for connecting Emirates business flight. Lounge large but not enough toilets and not very clean either. Long queues which I would not expect in business class lounge. Wondering how Emirates manages when they are ordering so many new aircraft and cannot cope with the present business class lounge.,lounge
1035,Citibank and AMEX offer the use of this lounge as a benefit to having their cards but it isn't much of a benefit when you can't find a seat to sit in. I have used this lounge in the past and it has been pretty handy. The last time we couldn't find anywhere to sit- not that it bothered the staff at all. People often hold empty seats for others with their cabin luggage that remain empty for hours. Other people use it as a hotel and sleep on two chairs. The Wifi doesn't work very well although there are some computers there that are popular. The food and beverages on offer are pretty good but the one shower needs a makeover and there seems to be corrosive gunk on all the fittings in the washroom that really should have been taken care of years ago. The furniture has taken a moderate beating and has been there since day one. The concept is great but it has become a victim of it's own success needing refurbishment enlargement and some better standards.,lounge
1036,The lounge was too far from the terminal. The food was not really that hot. The fruits and beverages was ok. The staff told us wifi was going to be fixed soon but I waited for almost 2 hours and still none. Accommodating staff great six sense spa offer but it was so limited - I was only allowed to use 1 treatment instead of at least 2.,lounge
1037,This lounge is overcrowded and very noisy. Food good great service but we were there from 2100 to 0240 and it gradually got worse with a number of people standing up and not being able to get a seat at all. I do not agree with the idea of asking people traveling in economy to use another lounge. I will in future organise my connections so I can limit time in this lounge.,lounge
1038,Pleasantly surprised by this lounge. Choice of various styles of seating. Plenty of hot food choices which was good as we had a five hour layover. What was exceptional was seeing a chef testing the temperature of the food in trays. I have not seen this before anywhere and many times endured cold offerings even in so called first tier airlines. Most impressed with Finnair for this.,lounge
1039,"This was our first visit to this Lounge - what a disappointment! We arrived just after 1300 hours and were looking forward to some nourishment before our return flight to the UK. But the only food on offer was a vegetable soup with cheese some limp brown chopped up lettuce tasteless beetroot - the potatoes tomatoes cucumber and coleslaw were all empty! To make matters worse there appeared to be no one on duty to replenish these dishes. Even the apple cake had dried out! Very disappointing considering it was the height of the lunch hour. The drinks were plentiful and varied. As others have said the lounge had obviously been recently refurbished but all the Loungers on the upper level and the comfortable seats were occupied leaving just ""plastic like"" moulded chairs and tables? Not the best! To make matters worse an hour later saw an invasion of passengers for the far east and when we went to refill our glasses - as if by magic - suddenly there was Minestrone soup a hot chicken and rice dish hot dogs a selection of fresh salads a selection of breads and fresh fruits. Sorry Finnair but my fare included the entry price to this Lounge I we were entitled to parity of service - which we certainly did not get.",lounge
1040,Used the Non Schengen Lounge for our late night departure ex Helsinki. The Lounge was clean and very comfortable with plenty of choices for Drinks both Alcoholic and Soft Drinks. As this was the last flight for the night there were only a few limb lettuce leaves and Soup left so if you planned to Eat before the flight you would be very disappointed!,lounge
1041,The Dubai Business Class lounge is not big enough for the number of passengers using it so it is difficult to find a seat. There are long queues for the toilets. If you have more than a couple of hours in the lounge then it feels a lot lot longer as the seats are not good for relaxing with very few foot stools. The food options are limited. At least there is free Wi-Fi.,lounge
1042,This shared lounge is very poor. Although there is enough space (a small room allocated to Emirates First Class) the food and drink selection is small. Food is not made to order and runs out quickly. This lounge is shared by so many airlines and card holders that it does not feel special. As a First Class passenger I feel the old lounge shared with South African Airways was so much better. Sadly this has now closed.,lounge
1043,Quiet comfortable and relaxing. A good variety of hot and cold food and excellent selection of beverages. It is enhanced by the fact that all of the EK flights from Gatwick are B777s (rather than A380s) meaning that there will never be more than 40 people in there at any one time. The reception staff are helpful and wait until the queue at the departure gate has cleared before calling the flight meaning that you can leave the lounge and get straight on to the plane.,lounge
1044,As a silver card member I'm entitled to access to the Al Reem lounge at Abu Dhabi. I can't compare it to the Pearl lounge in T3 (I've never accessed it) but as a business class lounge it was good with plenty of breakfast options available stocked and manned bar area plenty of seating (if in a somewhat weird 3 tiered room) and newspapers and magazines available. However Wi-Fi was unavailable whilst I was there (and the staff couldn't fix it) and there was only 3 staff to man the bar clear plates and update the breakfast area and thus they struggled to keep up with demand in a less than half full lounge. The only real problem is the lack of toilet facilities in the lounge for its size.,lounge
1045,Small but uncrowded lounge. Quality of service food and drink during my stay was excellent. Free wifi and tv/newspapers available. The criticism would be the lack of a sleeping zone but few lounges of this size would be likely to have that. Definitely much better than either the Al Reem lounge in AUH.,lounge
1046,Previously Etihad gold and silver card holders used the Pearl business lounge in terminal three complete with comfy seats and smoking room but now (due to overcrowding) have to use the Al Reem lounge in the old terminal 1. All Etihad flights to Europe and Asia arrive and leave from the new T3 so this becomes awkward. On arrival you have to bypass security and walk (10 mins) to the old terminal and the lounge. This lounge is not a patch on the T3 lounge with a very limited food selection (drinks are fine). There is no comfortable seating area and no papers to pass the time. The next problem is there is no smoking room so you must use the smoking room in the far corner of T1. Then of course to catch your flight head back to T3 and go through security which becomes more of a muddle if another flight arrives as you do - as nobody knows where they are going and can cause another delay.,lounge
1047,Beautiful lounge but lacks in the food category. We each paid 48 euros and thought it might be a good alternative to dinner but at 7:10pm there was no dinner in sight and no real food other than salad soup and bread. Lots of drinks available but in general quite disappointing due to no other food/ snacks available. Wouldn't recommend it if you are mainly looking for a meal and drinks.,lounge
1048,Helsinki was cold grey and closed it being 12th Night public holiday and so we resorted to a long wait in the Finnair lounge. Catering is quite simple but delicious much better than having endless choices of tepid offerings you don't want. Staff charming couldn't do enough. The lounge large and calm. Lots of Finnish understated design and the raised area with the recliners is the height of deliciousness. When it is crowded the centre can be a little canteen like but crowds are crowds and the staff do a brilliant job.,lounge
1049,This is the best lounge I have been to in Australia/New Zealand there is very little to fault apart from the distance from customs/immigration. Great food with enormous selection of both hot and cold choices and friendly but unobtrusive service. Good selection of reading material. Natural light and views of the tarmac and gates with very comfortable decor. Bathrooms top notch. with great amenity kits and more than adequate business facilities. Added bonus of being able to board your flight direct from the lounge.,lounge
1050,Overcrowded hot and not really that pleasant. The food on offer was nice enough but the crowds of people made me want to get out of there fast.,lounge
1051,So much more pleasant than the crowded horror that is the Business Class Lounge. The First Class Lounge is an oasis of calm. Excellent food staff and facilities.,lounge
1052,Quite a small but pleasant lounge. Nice reception from the staff and frequent offer to refill drinks and so forth. As it was an early flight we enjoyed a cooked to order breakfast. Very good. You could also help yourself to cold cuts and bakery if you didn't want a cooked meal.,lounge
1053,"We were flying First Class Etihad-Europe having previously travelled First Class on Qantas BA Air France and Emirates. The lounge turns out to be the New Zealand Airlines ""standard"" lounge. This is very much not what we expect when we pay for First Class. It's a nice enough lounge crowded despite a quiet night at the airport (I'd hate to see it on a slightly busy night!) but nothing more. Would not reach Business Class standards for any other airline. As we sit in the lounge we are not planning to fly Etihad again. There's a chance for catch up on the flights and in the other ports but really we've made a decision to fly First Class because we want ""First Class"" funnily enough! This is not a First Class lounge and as stated above I'd be disappointed if I'd paid Business Class for this. Part of the real pleasure of starting a holiday is sitting back in the lounge with that first glass of champagne. We last travelled Emirates and while they didn't have a dedicated First lounge (shared with Business) the facilities food and champagne are great on board. This is the first time I've ever bothered to write such a review which reflects our disappointment. Etihad has a fair bit of catching up to do at this early stage. There's no way that we'll depart Melbourne with Etihad again. Do what Air France do escort your First Class passengers (in CDG at least) to the lounge make sure they're comfortable and come and get them when it's time to leave. If you're going to ask for 5-10 times the fare make the customer feel a little special!",lounge
1054,Etihad business class travellers have to fight for seats in this lounge. This lounge is too small and regularly too full to accommodate all business class passengers. Food quality has declined.,lounge
1055,The most uncomfortable chairs in a lounge I've been in. Not relaxing at all! Whoever designed this lounge is a designer - not a business traveler! Very limited selection of food that did not look attractive at all. A few cheap wines and some beer.,lounge
1056,Unimpressive. Low slung Scandinavian furniture - all style no comfort. A five hour transit ended in a sore back. Food supplies are meagre - a few limp salad leaves and a lacklustre pumpkin soup. Plenty of alcohol but not much to soak it up with. The place is littered with dirty crockery and glassware - the attendants only cruise by every now and then to clear it all away. No soap in the women's toilet and the men's urinal (I'm told) smells. Expected better. This is one of the most frugal lounges I have been in.,lounge
1057,There was not much food a few salad leaves that was it bearing in mind that the lounge was half full. The toilet was dirty. Considering that this is the flagship lounge of Finnair. You can really see cost cuttings in that lounge. This lounge has not much to offer.,lounge
1058,The location is convenient in terms of being next to the boarding gate but it is a trek away from the shops etc. The lounge is a common one for first and business class and has ample seating. The display of food is impressive and the it is all halal. Toilets and showers available as well as free internet access. Overall an excellent lounge.,lounge
1059,The lounge is smart with comfortable seats but air conditioning was not on and the lounge was very uncomfortable. A group of passengers got very loud and were becoming a distraction and disturbing other passengers. When brought to the attention of the staff they were not interested. Food and drinks were adequate several TVs.,lounge
1060,Pleasant comfortable lounge. Ai conditioned unlike gate lounges upstairs. Good selection of small food and beverage. TV internet showers if required. Shared with other airlines but not crowded when we were there.,lounge
1061,I have used the Flybe lounge in Edinburgh twice the past few months. It is a dismal place with threadbare furniture and minimal facilities. Hardly know why they bother with it.,lounge
1062,I used the Flybe business lounge back at the beginning of October 2013. It is even more minimalist and threadbare than its Edinburgh counterpart. You wonder why they bother with it in the first place if it cannot be made brighter and more welcoming There is a washroom out the back but the advice is to use it only if you really need to for it's in the most dreadful and dilapidated state .Pretty poor show the whole thing.,lounge
1063,Totally disappointed by this so called premium lounge. Not only was it overcrowded the staff offered no help when you are circling around trying to find a place to sit and eat. The staff at reception was fine. The toilets seemed too small for volume of passengers and I looked for the so called shower facilities in vain. The whole design on top of the huge crowd using it certainly gives you the impression that you are in a canteen and not in a premium lounge. On the return flight the plane from Kuala Lumpur landed in Abu Dhabi around midnight and not only trying to find the lounge from where you got off this time was a nightmare but when I got to the lounge I did not bother to eat (despite being hungry) as I was not prepared to explore every corner just to find a comfortable place to eat. Etihad please wake up and upgrade this lounge I am not being demanding but when you pay to travel business class some comfort in transit is not too much to ask.,lounge
1064,Senses Spa would be one of the best things here. Lounge is too small for the morning traffic. Food was good and a variety. Staff is too loud. Waiting for the shower and a line for the toilet - never happened with me before in a Business class lounge. Etihad people need to understand what a lounge means - and not just free food and drinks.,lounge
1065,The few dishes that are offered weren't replenished at my visit. In some cases I was met by an empty serving tray of a few odd pieces of crumbles. Drink section was extremely dirty with a lot of spills that weren't cleaned up. The soda machine was leaking. Seating area was better cleaned but I already felt uneasy from the food and drinks section and left soon. There are other lounges in HEL airport maybe better chose another one even if it means you need to pay for your entry.,lounge
1066,Very noisy as the lounge was filled over its capacity. It was not the relaxing place you want between flights. Stylish yes. But I found it to be stress-inducing not relaxing. The spa-section mentioned below is closed for good and the lounge offers nothing out of the ordinary. In fact it doesn't even offer the ordinary. The food sections cannot be called a food section. It has some cookies and sodas. There is a bar with a very nice bartender but the drinks offered were of the lower quality. If you like food and decent drinks you need to pay extra.,lounge
1067,Lovely calm Nordic feel to lounge. Unfortunate that they did not plan it in a part of the airport with views of the runways. Views of air bridges are not inspiring. That said the facilities are great. Apple computers Marimekko and Iitala crockery - very stylish. A much improved food selection which I would have liked to have enjoyed more of but saved myself for inflight meal HEL-SIN. Comfortable seating and a choice of tables and chairs lounge sets or recliners.,lounge
1068,Were pleasant and comfortable. A good selection of snacks and drinks available along with a fast internet connection. Staff were attentive and it was a good experience.,lounge
1069,The first time I have used this new lounge and a great improvement from the shared lounge that Emirates used before. The lounge is not that easy to find. It is located near the arrival desks on the left hand side via a lift to the 3rd floor. Once found it is clean only thing missing is a smoking area. Food excellent but limited choice of drinks but for Sri Lanka this is heaven and compared to the shared lounge is a real treat. Staff friendly and helpful.,lounge
1070,Severely over crowded queues for showers and wcs. Noisy and as previously described like a street market. Not what we expect as a business customer. Didn't bother attempting the showers on the return leg. Enough of a problem to over ride any of Emirates' other benefits.,lounge
1071,This is not an Etihad lounge as they do not have one at JFK. This lounge is so poor it is unbelievable unhappy person on reception only one person cleaning up the food way below lounge level no champagne warm white wine. We left as soon as possible. Avoid this place it really is very bad.,lounge
1072,Rather small feeling crammed and very crowded. It was difficult to find a seat and impossible to use one of the computer terminals. Staff were busy in their attempts to replenish food and beverages. The lounge needs to be much bigger.,lounge
1073,Although this is the new lounge in Terminal 3 it can get very crowded. Food and beverage is good but seating is a little close together and there is not much privacy. The Six Senses Spa is great. Overall not a bad lounge but I do not know why Etihad chose to create such a small lounge in contrast to the number of people who use it. Etihad needs to attend to the washrooms as they were not what you would expect from a business class lounge.,lounge
1074,This is the much heralded Finnair long haul lounge in Helsinki. Finnair flights from Europe and Asia arrive and depart within a few hours time frame in the afternoon. meaning the airport and in particular the lounges fill up during those hours. This new VIA lounge has a pleasant and light northern-european design but still feels a bit claustrophobic because of the number of people and the high-density seating. Staff welcoming and free Wifi available. Food and drink situation however not great. Limited choice and low quality (wine from a tap for example). The spa section is free for the highest status members of the Finnair FF program but not for the same level One World frequent flyers.,lounge
1075,Not really up to scratch in terms of space or facilities. It feels like an original frequent flyer lounge from when they first appeared twenty years ago. Limited computers and inadequate toilet/shower facilities.,lounge
1076,Far too small for the number of passengers. What idiot calculated that 10 urinals would be sufficient for the hundreds of male passengers? Queuing in the cramped sweaty lavatory is NOT what you want after a 14 hour flight from Brisbane. The whole lounge is a disaster area and quite a joke after reading the Emirates web-site description.,lounge
1077,Use the lounge about twice a month. It is now becoming apparent that it is not First Class. The wooden furniture is damaged (chipped and scratched) and the upholstered furniture dirty and worn. It is very noisy with all the announcements from the departure hall below and this lounge must have the worst wifi on the planet. The staff are friendly and helpful and selection of food and beverages are generally good. However I found the Lounge in T1 (currently closed) far more superior giving a much greater feeling of elegance privacy and exclusivity. It is much smaller with almost no sound interferences.,lounge
1078,Stopped off here on our way to Auckland in Feb 2011. Very pleasant lounge with selection of snack foods and drinks. Very attentive service who supplied good coffee as and when required. Quite a few people in but still nice and relaxed. When our flight was called we more or less boarded straight from the lounge - nice touch.,lounge
1079,The a la carte dining was superb with great attention by the staff. Again the Six Senses Spa is great and just what you need before a long flight. The food and beverage section is well maintained and is of a high quality. Overall this is a fine lounge and rates as one of the best I have been in.,lounge
1080,Excellent catering and drinks selection complete with bar service. Abundant large screen iMacs for use as well as Wi-fi. Well-kept though few toilets with a single shower so there can be a queue. There is a Six Senses Spa which gives complimentary 15 minute treatments with free clothes pressing. Inside the Spa are 6 more showers. The rush hour seems to be from 8-9 am. It was virtually empty before and after that.,lounge
1081,Used this lounge twice March 2011 on our way to and from New Zealand. Quiet spacious and clean with endless supplies of beverages and food and restaurant area. Very comfortable sofas if required. Excellent facility well worth using except why are the showers outside the Lounge? And why are the toilets separate from the showers ? You have to exit and walk quite a way before locating the Shower Room (which frankly could do with sprucing up).,lounge
1082,This is a new lounge a huge improvement. The facility was immaculate and offered nice views with comfortable chairs excellent food separate dining area well designed toilets and business centre. Lounge staff attentive and friendly though the reception staff member on duty seemed more interested in chatting on her mobile phone than being attentive.,lounge
1083,A new lounge we did not know existed. Very Welcome .Staff very welcoming. Everything clean and spotless and food and beverage selection excellent. Good scenic views of the Bosphorous and airport.,lounge
1084,Outstanding staff and first rate food and beverage. The bathrooms offer hot showers. Free wifi and champagne with canapes was an ideal way to start a flight.,lounge
1085,Transit time around 2.5 hours and went to main Business Lounge. Not too difficult to find seat for 2 people. Internet speed is extremely slow which I had to give up eventually.,lounge
1086,Probably the dirtiest lounge I have ever been to even touching the fridge door to get a drink was unpleasant. The carpets are dirty the available cutlery not clean tables were not wiped old plates with dried food and drinks everywhere. Rubbish baskets overflowing. A soup was available some time during the day but the dish was practically empty with dried left over in and around it. A couple of sandwiches in plastic and some apples. Coffee no tea. Water and coke and 2 more soft drinks were available. Toilets smell bad broken and only one had a bit of toilet paper.,lounge
1087,Apart from the fact it's too big and impersonal there are only two shower rooms and the wi-fi is ridiculously slow. Brisbane has as many showers for only 2 flights a day. It's enough for me to move to another airline.,lounge
1088,Compares more than favourably with the Air New Zealand lounge. Pity there was no info on joining Skywards and the lounge staff gave us incorrect info which resulted in us not being credited with miles for the flight.,lounge
1089,I normally use the main business lounge but a 15 minute walk from the main transfer area came across this smaller lounge near gate 122. I arrived at 2300 and found only 8 other passengers there. Food and drink selection seemed good. Excellent wifi. Quite a long way to walk to my gate - however more than compensated by this excellent little lounge.,lounge
1090,Disappointing experience. In spite of reasonably good food and a spacious layout the Emirates T3 lounge disappoints - at arrival at 4AM in the morning seating was widely available but around 6AM passengers clearly surpassed the lounge's capacity. WiFi became slow and signal dropped repeatedly access to basic food required waiting in line longer than acceptable toilets and showers were constantly full. I support other reviews about the inadequate layout of bathrooms and showers - the lounge is simply not good enough for a 4-star airline when showers and bathrooms do not have cold water water pressure is pesky and you have to wait in line for a free bathroom.,lounge
1091,I was very impressed with the service and food - well run clean and enjoyable visit. A shame they do not use the same food and quality on the planes.,lounge
1092,"Whilst this is apparently still a temporary venue, it is an insult to passengers who've paid good money to travel Business Class. What makes this seem even worse is that most Garuda flights to Australia leave Bali very late in the evening. Customers arrive at the lounge after a late checkout from their hotel, feeling tired, looking forward to catching a few hours sleep on the 'flat bed', it is reasonable to assume that they may wish to enjoy a few quiet drinks and a light meal before hopping onto the plane. There are some single armchairs, no tables for putting food/ drinks on, very few power outlets, poor reading materials, no private areas, with the food choices/presentation befitting a canteen. Luckily I had read that it was possible to get a wine/ beer if you know that you must ask for it.  This is all such a pity because the actual flying experience is very good and quite comparable to other airlines charging similar prices for their premium travel.",lounge
1093,Who in their right minds would not put toilets in with the shower facilities. You go to have a shower - then you walk in thinking you would go to the toilet first. You are then told toilet facilities are down the hall somewhere - outside the shower facilities. This must have been designed by a lunatic. The food is nothing near as good as the old business class lounge. Usually it is cold and dry - in the numerous times I have used this lounge the food has been really dreadful. Very disappointing.,lounge
1094,I have used this lounge about 7 times this year. As a smoker I thank Emirates for providing a smoking area. The staff were excellent - I have yet to try the A la Carte dinning as I only spend about one hour in the lounge. I would like to have trolleys for passengers when leaving the lounge as sometimes its a long way to the gates and secondly a larger selection of drinks.,lounge
1095,LGW is by far the better of Emirates London airport Lounges and the food was better than their DXB Lounges (which is not hard) or any of their SE Asia Lounges. Excellent food and drinks choices several TV's plenty Internet access a very spacious and comfortable lounge with professional and courteous staff. Excellent all round.,lounge
1096,"Absolutely ridiculous that this lounge is still a temporary lounge - the airport has been built, restaurants are open other lounges have been open for more than six months and Garuda  still haven't got their act together. I'm told that Bintang isn't available till 7pm? Maybe Garuda should consider giving a refund to compensate travellers who have paid for business class expecting service - or team up with an open Lounge the other airlines have done. It's not rocket science. And even if Garuda insist on keeping the temporary lounge, at least provide a decent service - it wouldn't kill you.",lounge
1097,The lounge have lots of facilities and is overall satisfied. with plenty of seats nice view to the airside friendly staffs. But air-conditional not always working the lounge is a little bit warm. The lounge does not have much food to eat but with enough kind of drink. I went for shower two times (I booked return trip) the first time the shower room it have no shampoo gels or even towels but the second time it was just like an 4 star hotel room which is tidy and with all the things i want.,lounge
1098,This is definitely not a business class lounge there are no toilet facilities - you have to use the public ones. Food is ok but wine is below average and you have to chase a staff member to get a wine or beer. We keep being told that this is a temporary lounge but no one can ever tell us when the new lounge will be ready - the new airport has been open some 18 months now - how long can is possibly take. It is disappointing as the facilities onboard in business class are very good with the Lounge in Denpasar being the only let down.,lounge
1099,Very nice new lounge for Emirates at the Mumbai airport. I think it is the first dedicated lounge EK has set up in India. In the past Emirates biz/first passengers used the Clipper lounge at Mumbai airport shared by many other airlines so this is a welcome change. Used the lounge around 8 am while waiting for my 9:55 am flight to Dubai. Not to crowded took a seat some reading material and got a cappuccino. Separate dining and seating areas. There were Indian and international breakfast items available in the buffet but somehow it seemed to early to eat and had a nice business breakfast to look fwd to on the flight so skipped eating here. Decent bathrooms with 2 showers also a nice touch. Toiletries and towels available.,lounge
1100,Emirates have produced a lounge of exceptional comfort and service. The new lounge offers comfortable seating good business services and excellent food and drinks - the style follows Emirates other lounges.,lounge
1101,It could be a good lounge is a little more thought went into it. I have got over the vastness of it and strange layout meandering over the first floor of the terminal. The downsides are the overcrowded and impersonal greeting at the reception the poor shower facilities and slow internet service. Upside is the good food and extensive beverages on offer.,lounge
1102,I have seen the business class lounge a few times and whilst the staff are nice and food is okay the rest is overcrowded with poor showers and very limited seating at peak times. Now I use the First Class lounge and what a difference. Restaurant style dining beautiful shower rooms nice TV pods. Staff okay but the aircon is switched down and you need blankets to keep warm!,lounge
1103,The lounge cannot qualify as either a Business or certainly not First class lounge and should not be promoted as such. Food is at best basic dipping to appalling. No alcohol served unless asked for then only beer and wine and not promoted. They have been promising a new lounge for 12 months. The old lounge in the old terminal although sub average was better. No shower or restroom given 1 star to both bar and restroom only because I can't submit without adding a score!,lounge
1104,Transit of 8 hours after arriving in from Australia to connect onto AMS. Lounge extremely warm one half closed off until close to 8pm. Food terrible alcohol hidden behind a bar never saw any staff member there finally helped myself. No towels in shower asked reception however nothing happened. Major gripe was after asking if I could pay to upgrade to first class was told they could not help me and I would need to go to cashier which is located landside. Therefore I was expected to clear customs to access this. Why couldn't they pick up the phone and ask? Major difference in staff compared to the inflight cabin crew who were outstanding in business class. Not impressed at all.,lounge
1105,We arrived at 7am and found a very nice space in which to spend an hour or so. Its not an intimate lounge and the toilet count is poor but it is generally light and airy breakfast food court was excellent and the flight announcement was well timed.,lounge
1106,Its a fair trek from the main T3 concourse but once found was a very nice space in which to spend an hour before boarding. All the facilities one would expect including an excellent and well serviced food court and bar. Very helpful and attentive staff. Direct boarding of the aircraft from the lounge was the final bonus.,lounge
1107,Disappointing - felt the lounge in the old terminal was better. In the T3 lounge no comfortable areas to sit - tip go to the furthest end of the lounge in front of the kids area as its quieter there if you need to rest. A very confusing lounge - certainly not a business lounge at all more like a waiting room with free food - which costs you the price of a business ticket!,lounge
1108,Domestic departures was through the old domestic arrivals area. Business lounges for both domestic and international flights were fenced off parts of the main concourses with no computers available. No alcohol was on display but I discovered that in the international lounge a waitress would bring you a glass of wine if you asked for one.,lounge
1109,No alcoholic beverages are available (or at least not on display). The domestic lounge had very worn furniture with rips in some of the upholstery. The domestic lounge had a shower in the mens toilet which I used but only cold water.,lounge
1110,Very disappointing. Difficult to find somewhere to sit chairs not comfortable for long waits food disappointing - I am not into stew and casserole type dishes at 6am not very much on offer only muffins. As with other parts of the airport only hot water dispensed from taps in rest rooms had to go and get bottled water so that I could clean my teeth. Some serious thought needs to be given to the layout and service.,lounge
1111,It was spacious clean bright well air-conditioned with ample seating a wide choice of good quality food and drink and helpful staff. It is vast and if people take the trouble to walk beyond the initial seating area they will find ample seating at both tables and of the armchair variety. During the 8 hours we spent there (from 6.30am - 2.30pm) we sat in a section of the lounge (approximately 30 arm-chairs and a 'cafeteria' area of approx 100 chairs) with only 4 other people.,lounge
1112,Very impressed with Lounge facilities food/drink presentation and Staff. Makes for a great start for a long flight when you can relax and enjoy quality pre-flight ambience. This was our introduction to Emirates and we were very pleased with the experience. Have since tried other Lounges in Dubai and Paris and would rate the Brisbane Lounge as the best.,lounge
1113,Lounge is spacious and lots comfortable chairs. Internet speed is good but the choice of foods are limited. Although for some passengers food may not be the things to look for but I like to try local foods and due to time constraints in certain country lounges may be the last place to try and have some local dish.,lounge
1114,Lounges set up was nice lots of lights. Because of this lighting which is good but it has disadvantages - generates heat and room temperatures becomes warmer. Staff are very friendly and helpful although they need further training. Supervisors and Lounge manager should be try harder to make this lounge to be among the best.,lounge
1115,This is still a temporary lounge which is simply partitioned off from the rest of the terminal. Didn't have and food or drink. Lounges comfortable but only just enough available. As it is really just a part of the main concourse it suffers from the continuous announcements. Not really relaxing but better than the main terminal I guess. Will be interested to see what GA comes up with once the terminal works are complete.,lounge
1116,I have been in terrible lounges in some terrible airports that are quieter and better laid out than Emirates Terminal 3 lounge. I have on some occasions chosen not to even use the facilities as they are so poor. I take the walk and go back to the old lounges in the older terminal. At least it is quieter and does not have a hundred people queuing for every service.,lounge
1117,The lounge is combined F & C class and quite spacious with lots of seating options. A warm welcome by staff at the front desk. Lots of food options as well as Champagne. Bathrooms were clean and tidy. One downer is that there are no windows but this is the way AKL airport is set out. When ready for boarding we were escorted to the gate and the airbridge to the upper deck. A very nice experience.,lounge
1118,A nice and cosy lounge similar to AKL but with windows. Morning departure so I didn't sample the booze but the espresso was excellent. A lot of reading materials staff friendly and welcoming and escorted us to the gate when boarding. Is it just me or are the Emirates Ground Staff doing a better job than their cabin crew.,lounge
1119,Much better than the old lounge in the old airport but very different what they tell you on the web site. Only beer and vodka available. Food extremely limited. No service. No lounge toilets and have to use public toilets outside. Nice comfortable chairs.,lounge
1120,An excellent lounge every bit the equal of Emirates lounge at Gatwick. If anything the food quality was marginally superior to Gatwick.,lounge
1121,A badly designed linear cafeteria which is noisy and stuffy. There appears to be a deliberate attempt to minimise the amount of comfortable seating. As for the showers there aren't enough of them for the volume of passengers and the water is limited to a trickle. The old lounge was marginally better than the new one. Compared to the Emirates lounge in Gatwick and Singapore this Dubai lounge is a disgrace.,lounge
1122,Garuda Business Flyer so went into the separate part for Business Class not much in way of food or beverages sitting where everybody who walks past to departure lounges looks in. Better off paying and going to the Premier Lounge.,lounge
1123,Lounge was very small with comfy chairs that were now quite dirty and stained. Food selection poor. Magazines and papers were available at the door and there was a tv. Lounge staff announced departing flights. The 1 female toilet was very dated and had a dodgy lock.,lounge
1124,The lounge was large with a variety of comfy chairs. There was a quiet room that had a 3 seater couch and other small chairs and tables. There were 3 computers and lots of powerpoint/recharge points for laptops and tablets. The food selection was good although I felt there was more on the Asian side and as I am a bit finicky I was not so fussed. Lots of drinks and hubby was even given a refrigerated glass for his beer. The facilities were very clean and tidy as was the bathroom shower. There was a shower but there did not appear to be any towels and when I commented on the shower to the bathroom attendent but there was no mention of clean towels forthcoming. The staff were fabulously friendly. Our flight was delayed 3 hours and the staff passed around blankets and as it was late they turned down the piped music and dimmed the lights.,lounge
1125,Dreadful place. arrived at 5am to find people sleeping across comfortable seats covered with blankets. I complained about this to a security guard and he said they shouldn't be doing it and he would wake them up. Joke. About an hour later I went to the desk and told the girls that this was unacceptable and they again said it was not allowed. But I pointed to one chap who was in their line of vision who had been sprawled out when we arrived and he was still there. They said they would go round and wake them up. We left to board an hour later and he and others were still asleep. My neighbour complained about this happening a month ago and got a reply from customer services saying this sleeping across seats was going to be stopped. Obviously has not. Where have all the people come from who now use this lounge?,lounge
1126,This is simply the worst Business Class lounge I have ever used. It is a chaotic mass of economy class over-spill. I had a 10 hour wait for my flight during which time I expected to relax complete some work and enjoy some quiet time. How wrong I was! On entering the lounge 98% of seating was occupied with people fast asleep draped over the settees and arm chairs all surrounded by mountains of hand luggage. A number of strategically placed screaming babies adding to the feeling of misery which was soon to be magnified by the stampede of bodies pushing and shoving to get to the main snack area and fill their plates with as much food as possible. Poor manners and attitude appear to be the accepted norm within this facility and you soon realise there's not much difference between here and downstairs on the main concourse (In fact Burger King was quieter!). Another side issue is the Wi-Fi facility - My dial-up connection in 1999 was far far quicker! I pay a little extra to enjoy a little more exclusivity and comfort offered by Business Class - it's non-existent at Dubai's Emirates Business Lounge in fact to be accurate it's awful!,lounge
1127,Lounge full no room to sit - very noisy. Toilets a disgrace staff totally unconcerned. Really disappointed with this terminal.,lounge
1128,Lounge isn't really Business Class quality and it doesn't give much privacy. At the time I entered the Lounge there were many children running around. Food selection not very good just cheese sandwiches.,lounge
1129,This is one of the best Lounge at Jakarta airport nicely designed with comfy furniture with views over the apron. Free wifi and workstations are available. As my flight to Bangkok is in the morning they served breakfast with egg stations with live cooking plenty of toast juices coffee/tea and plenty of reading materials.,lounge
1130,This was our first time in the new T3 Business lounge and it was a disappointment. It didn't feel anything special and was quite crowded. The lounge just doesn't feel like a business class lounge - more like a waiting room. We didn't see much food on offer just hot / cold drinks muffins fruit ice cream. We didn't want to lose our seats so we didn't really get to see a lot of the lounge or what food might have been on offer. All in all not the best in business lounges by a long shot definitely needs some re-thinking and re-planning.,lounge
1131,This was our second time in this lounge and it was just as good as the first visit. Lovely spacious lounge with lot's of good comfortable seating. The choice of food was good with a selection of hot & cold dishes plus snacks coffee & full bar.,lounge
1132,In fact its not a lounge for Business Class ticket holders its a lounge for anyone with $12.00 to spend on entrance. The lounge was old worn out and full of people who had paid the $12.00 for the privilege of a good TV free booze and snacks. Can't blame them but there was no place to sit so we stood outside.,lounge
1133,As soon you clear customs when departing you will be approached by Garuda employees offering you access to the Garuda Lounge for $100.000 rph Take my advice and jump on it. We all paid the $100.000 rph and headed in. Bintang on tap spirits food tea coffee and free internet access on their computers. Staff ask you what flight you are on and will let you know when its last drinks and time to board. Worth every cent.,lounge
1134,Lounge is located in right in the front of entry way from check in rows so it is easy to find. The selection of food is quite vary mainly Indonesian fare but there are some western style selection as well. Beverages selection quite plenty with beer available as well for free of charge. The lounge can be quite crowded in the morning and late afternoon. Bathroom were clean with staff kept going around and cleaning them. Staff were very helpful but they need to improve their English to serve their non Indonesian customers. Overall the lounge is very good compare to European standards.,lounge
1135,The Smiles lounge in Terminal 2 Rio de Janeiro (GIG) International Airport opened in 1999 as the VARIG main lounge in Brazil (Smiles is the name of Varig's frequent flyer program now with GOL Airlines). At that time it was the best South America lounge and was used by Star Alliance (Lufthansa United and of course Varig). It was an outstanding lounge with separated areas for first class and business class showers smoke room plenty of reading materials excellent beverages and high quality food. In 2008 Varig went out of business and GOL acquires Varig routes mileage program and VIP lounges. Strangely as GOL uses the Terminal 1 they continued using these lounge in Terminal 2 so it is impossible to board a GOL flight and use its own lounge. The lounge is used by a lot of airlines (Lufthansa United US Airways Diners Club card menbers among others). The good part is that as a big lounge it never get crowded they have good (a bit used) furniture and luxury res trooms. Unfortunately the first class section is now closed the drinks offered are cheap and the food minimal.,lounge
1136,Visited the lounge 3 times in July. Not a bad facility - not the best but serves its purpose. Gets really crowded in the peak morning departure times but quiet at other periods. Staff quite friendly but not much chat with customers. A fair choice of hot and cold food but needs to be improved to match airlines such as Malaysia Cathay Singapore etc. Small smoking room area nice bar area at one end and 2 internet terminals = wifi not working when I visited the lounge. Washrooms very basic and the 1 shower room was so unpresentable that I preferred not to use it! Not bad for Garuda but they could so much better!,lounge
1137,Garuda Indonesia executive lounge is the biggest lounge facility at Soekarno-Hatta Airport. Located in Terminal E-F the lounge occupies an area of 1.419m2 comprising a 757sq m domestic executive lounge with a seating capacity of 148 seats and a 662sq m international executive lounge of 114 seats. The new lounge offers an array of facilities - fully-equipped business center with meeting rooms and IT support a quiet room a refreshment area with shower nursery a luggage area and praying room. As opposed to existing lounges that cater to credit card holders the new lounge is reserved exclusively for the comfort of Garuda Indonesia's Business Class passengers and Garuda Frequent Flyer (GFF) Gold and Platinum card members or Executive Card Plus members.,lounge
1138,Expensive is the first thing that comes to mind if you are not a member of Gulf Air's Golden Falcon FF program. The lounge charges access in chunks of 3 hours each and when you have a 7.5 and a 10 hour layover as I did that adds up. Sleeper seats at one end of the lounge but the lights have been positioned so as to shine directly into one's eyes and Gulf Air has to discover the concept of eye shades whether on their aircraft or here. The lounge does provide blankets and there is also a shower available to freshen up. While you will be told at check in that flights are not called the reverse is true - some flights are called (very disturbing to sleep when there are no earplugs available!) on a very odd seemingly random basis. The desk staff is obliging while service staff in the lounge tries to be unobtrusive but fails miserably clattering dishes and glassware making a lot of noise when replenishing food and drink etc.,lounge
1139,The Gulf Air lounge allows a 'pay per visit' for any traveller. I needed good wi-fi and some good breakfast. I paid £GBP35 each for the two of us. Very friendly staff and club lounge was immaculate with fast wi-fi. However at about 10.00am the remains of what was breakfast was cold and congealed at the self service food bar. I asked in the form of a complaint about the state of the breakfast bar. I was offered a fresh coffee (very good) by one of the girls and told that when the chef returned from his break that he would prepare us some breakfast. This he did. We were offered a plain omelette or some 'fresh' frittata. We opted for the frittata. Two small slices each with no accompaniment. Very disappointing and not worth the money we had paid. Even with the wi-fi and a total of 4 coffees GBP70 was a lot to pay. Will not be going there again.,lounge
1140,A nice little lounge located next to gate 7 in Terminal 4. Greeting was friendly and professional. Great views over the southern runway and the stands outside. Food and drink selection was very good but cannot quite compete with the Qatar Airways lounge. Small terminals with movies and series placed at most tables for entertainment. 3 Mac terminals with internet access if you have forgotten your computer and WiFi is available in the lounge as well. Very nice restrooms with showers if required.,lounge
1141,Situated overlooking the tarmac the lounge is large and airy with an adjoining self service food area. The central bar has a full selection of drinks including fizz. Full selection of newspapers WiFi and smart toilets and showers. Loads of seats including a section overlooking the aircraft. Because of T4 layout it is still a 5-8 minute walk to your gate even though you can see it from the lounge. Ours was a morning visit and there was a wide selection of hot breakfast food on offer. Well staffed this is a good lounge.,lounge
1142,Impressed by spacious and modern lounge in Bahrain airport. The seats were comfortable and able to get a view airside so we could watch the planes coming and going. The food was quite tasty and there was a reasonable selection.,lounge
1143,Used this lounge travelling with SriLankan Airlines. Very nice lounge which was refurbished and of good quality. Good selection of food and drinks. Staff were attentive. Showers were locked even though nobody using them not sure if this was because we were not Gulf air passengers. Toilets were clean. Wifi and computers available and seating including some comfortable chairs sofas and quiet rooms.,lounge
1144,Clean bright lounge with a nice relaxing ambience with good food and nice selection of drinks. Great to use clean toilets and the staff very pleasant to talk and interact with. Internet was good as was the Wi-Fi. Gets a little crowded at night time though.,lounge
1145,Excellent seating variety (it's possible to order a quiet room at an extra cost of 30 BHD). There's a good variety of hot food. It has a good selection of drinks and a espresso machine. Armchair equipped with a portable screen to watch a selection of movies. There's a family room with toys and a separate one for children and teens with XBOX stations. Free WI-FI. Clean toilets and courteous staff.,lounge
1146,What a contrast to their own lounge in Bahrain was fantastic on the outbound. They use a Service lounge used by number of airlines dark gloomy depressing. wireless involved sending your personal details and then a text to some number and after 9 tries never worked. Gave up in the end no alcoholic beverages at all. Some hot food but looked like it had been deep fried to its death and was verging on carbon. Staff smiling which is the great thing about Indian people always helpful and courteous. My Advice don't get to the airport to early and save hanging out in this lounge.,lounge
1147,Very comfortable with good selection of food and drink. Overlooking runway all down main side of lounge.,lounge
1148,Excellent lounge overlooking the departure gate. Very welcoming with good selection of food and drink and a good variety of seating options. Nice bathrooms. Friendly staff and good service.,lounge
1149,Plenty of space and comfortable seating on the evening I was there. The choice of quality foods impressed me. Staff attentive and offer to serve at your seat. Internet available to use and plenty of terminals available. Shower and bathroom amenities clean and available.,lounge
1150,"Awful horrible plastic cafe sort of place used now by Gulf Air following their move from Terminal 3 to Terminal 4. Was packed everything involved a queue (e.g. 5 minutes to enter; 5+ minutes to get a cup of coffee at the ""cute but oh-so-slow"" espresso/cappuchino coffee machine). The food bar had no forks (all had been used) for at least 25 minutes despite staff milling about (and chatting with each other plenty). No call service for airlines (hence had to join Gulf Air's uncontrolled mob at boarding time). Basically was glad to leave the place - will try hard to avoid it in future.",lounge
1151,Comfortable lounge with darkened sleeping area at one end. Selection of food limited but tasty. Not self-service. You choose what you want and it is prepared and brought to you.Staff only too pleased to do whatever they can for you. Reasonable selection of drinks. Internet available in 30 minute blocks (but I went back for several without a problem). Ejected at 2330 hrs as final Airport Security check closes shortly after this.,lounge
1152,A wonderful haven of peace and quiet. Helpful staff opened early to accomodate us as flight in was very late. Plenty of space wide selection of food and drink. Very good showers with nice towels provided,lounge
1153,This is a haven of peace at T3 and certainly one of the best lounges at Heathrow. Although small it has a calm feeling and has full facilities including full bar with good fizz and tasty snacks. Full internet for those who need to work or perhaps relax under the drapes awaiting your call to board. Gulf will lay on a buggy on request and also you are encouraged not to go to the gate until called from the lounge so you can board last. Look forward to trying the 5* lounge at BAH and the soon to be refurbished Gulf lounge at MCT,lounge
1154,GF lounge at BAH is the best I have encountered. From being met at the reception desk by the most courteous staff to being escorted to your gate if requested by the most profesional staff it is a truly enjoyable experience. Computers free wifi a huge choice of food from hot snacks to sandwiches drinks from the finest champagne to sodas. Staff will also pack you a lunch box for a long haul flight if requested - in this lounge you dont have to ask for anything as everything is offered. The lounge has an Arabian theme which is very comfortable. People often wonder what they are paying for with business and first class prices apart from the wonderful service offered on their flights this 5* star treatment in the lounge would put alot of 5* hotels to shame.,lounge
1155,New spacious lounge with comfortable chairs and sofas. A special area with massage chairs and TVs. Pod chairs. A business area with PCs. Plenty of outlets and flat screen TVs everywhere. Snacks hot (soup dim sum) and cold (salads sandwiches) and a variety of beverages are available with a central self-service counter international magazines and newspapers. Showers and clean restrooms. Toilets are high tech! WiFi works well. Flights are announced. Separate security checkpoint for first and business class and elite members provides entrance to the lounge which has direct access to gates. English proficiency of some staff was limited.,lounge
1156,A quite small lounge and in need of upgrading. Staff very pleasant and friendly reasonable choice of hot food at meal times. Quite crowded when I visited and no internet access working properly.,lounge
1157,"The lounge has undergone renovation to make it cleaner and a better layout. For frequent flyers it's a good lounge wife coffee soft drinks and packet nibbles for first or business it's not a good
lounge. No cocktails or hot food any sort of meals. Hawaiian would do better enticing more business and first class if they made a lounge for those classes as well as keeping their frequent flyer lounge. At Honolulu airport you are limited to lounge use. I'm a sapphire one world and no lounges available.
",lounge
1158,Furniture appears to be from the mid 80s. Not comfortable. No private toilets. Has a soda dispenser and a few coffee thermoses. No TV showing flight status. There appears to be a desk for an attendant but no staff was seen for the two hours we were there. There is free WiFi but that's about the only reason to visit this lounge. It's worth noting however that the WiFi login page's certificate was expired.,lounge
1159,The lounge itself is clean and well maintained. Seats are comfortable and it provides a respite from the noise of the rest of the terminals. The lounge falls short on catering miserably. People who pay premium prices for first/business class service or for Premier/Pualani Gold/Platinum memberships deserve far more than juice packets pretzels and coffee which they receive in coach class flights. Especially when other airline club lounges offer much more in varieties of foods like pastries fruits hot/cold foods beverages including alcoholic beverages. Hawaiian should work on this.,lounge
1160,This has to go down as the worst airline lounge I have been in. The air was thick with the smell of stale cigarette smoke it is a non smoking lounge. There is no food on offer not even a cracker and signs everywhere stating outside food is not allowed in lounge - offer some food if you don't want guests bringing it in. Coffee soda and juice are the items on offer. Very poor for a Business lounge Hawaiian Airlines should be ashamed.,lounge
1161,Truly pathetic no food  no alcohol? Coffee and soft drinks ? Extremely lame by world standards. One would think they would improve their offering considering what their partners like Qantas offer.,lounge
1162,Very basic and rather poor. Only juices tea and coffee. No food. Seats are rather uncomfortable. We only used the Wi-fi and then went elsewhere to have a drink and something to eat. Not good and no private washrooms.,lounge
1163,Pleasant enough space but very very basic. One TV. Juice soft drinks tea coffee & inflight bags of pretzels. No alcohol or other food. They're not licensed! There is free wifi - which is pretty quick.,lounge
1164,"A very impressive lounge located near gate 23 with a clear view of the runway. The variety of food and drinks offered is amazing, staff are very friendly and helpful. Plenty of room to lounge about, computers and printers available. There is also an area where you can take a quite nap which is dimly lit and away from the crowd. It is worth mentioning that some dishes are available by ordering, they make fresh for you, a very nice touch indeed.",lounge
1165,Quite a nice rather small lounge positioned one level down from the main gate area. Staff were very nice and friendly when I visited and offered help for everything. Good selection of hot and cold food and wide choice of beverages wine etc. Managed to find newspapers ands magazines that I like found a comfortable sleep and relaxed for 2 hours. Lacking of shower facilities but I guess there is no room to offer this in the facility looking at the size. For a small airline I thought this was a great lounge overall - and it was staff service that was so nice.,lounge
1166,"I really loved this lounge as it was very well lit and provided wonderful views of the airport, and is big and spacious. There were many different areas for different purposes : eating areas (with wonderful food), sleeping areas which had dim lighting and chez-longues, showers, TV areas, and sitting areas. Wifi was provided free of charge, and service was non-intrusive.",lounge
1167,Using this lounge for 4 hours last Dec 31st and only a hot soup type thing and no other hot food. Dried sandwiches chips and some sodas and a lot of alcoholic beverage. I'm sorry what can my family One of the poorest vip lounges I've visited. Dirty bathrooms and no amenities. Rude staff. BA - why do you bother with this lounge?,lounge
1168,Used this lounge as BA passenger. Really much improved my last visit here in May. The food was plentiful and of good quality the wine selection improved and the cleaning service coped well with a busy lounge. The dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy - no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct. Helpful staff and wonderful views. Excellent - well done on the improvements.,lounge
1169,A really nice lounge. Good view over the apron and runway. Plenty of seats - I was there mid morning. The food was excellent. Hot breakfast items still being served Well stocked bar with beer wine and spirits. An excellent coffer machine. Despite being a Spanish lounge in a Spanish city there were plenty of English language newspapers despite what other miserable people had previously stated. Some people should take a chill pill or get back to the public area. Timely flight announcements made allowing a relaxed short walk to the gate and straight onto the plane. Staff very friendly. A great experience.,lounge
1170,The lounge is large and quite good. The food and drink are acceptable. The absence of English-language newspapers is unacceptable.,lounge
1171,"The lounge is OK but the food and drink in the passenger terminal are infinitely better. I'd rather pay for the ceviche and pisco sours outside the lounge than sample the ""hospitality"" within. I realize that BA and Iberia operate separately within the IAG but reputational damage is shared.",lounge
1172,Iberia only has business class (not first) and this is a really good lounge. Even though it was late morning and well after the peak breakfast period (but nowhere near the Spanish lunch hour either) there was a nice buffet that including Spanish omelettes smoked salmon assorted breads and pastries and fruit/veggies/salad. The beverage area was well stocked: everything from soda to tomato juice to wine. I don't believe they offered a selection of liquors but they had a lot of wine and beer options. The space is open and inviting bathrooms were very nice and immaculately clean. My only criticism is that despite the open layout and good amount of space actual seating was hard to come by. That lounge is busy and there really aren't enough seats.,lounge
1173,This lounge is located in the satellite part of terminal 4 where most long haul Iberia flights and a few other carriers such as British Airways (the airline I flew in this case). You can access this lounge if you are in business or first class on Iberia or another oneworld airline or have oneworld emerald or sapphire status through your frequent flyer program. So though it seems many can access this lounge it is not a problem as the lounge is needlessly large with two symmetrical wings accommodating many at a time. Overall this lounge was fantastic as it was very spacious and comfortable with areas to eat work relax and even a separate sleeping room with privacy dividers. The bar was well stocked and contrary to the Sala Dali lounge I used in the main terminal 4 this had a well stocked buffet with many different options. However I did not like that in this lounge you must ask for Internet cards from the staff at the reception where you scratch off and enter a c ode that you enter in your device. This would be okay but it only last 30 minutes before you need to repeat the process. That being said the Internet speed is very fast. The staff did a good job keeping the food and drink well stocked and the whole area well kept but while they got the job done they didn't seem as though they really wanted to be there. Overall this is definetly a nice place to spend some time before a flight and if I was eligible to use the lounge again I would definetly take the time to do so.,lounge
1174,This is much bigger than the Velazquez Lounge at Madrid. It is quieter as well. There are superb areas offering wine and spirits as well basic sandwiches salads nuts crisps smoothies coffees teas milkshakes and juices. Plenty of newspapers and magazines (but it doesn't cater for English-speaking passengers in that category). There are internet terminals but they didn't seem to allow me to 'send' a message from them. Overall extremely impressive - if you had several hours between flights you would be comfortable here. There are just enough distractions and curiosities to pass the time in comfort!,lounge
1175,The lounge is easy to find despite the enormity of Madrid T4S. Once inside it is airy and spacious. There are shower facilities. The catering is very extensive - pasta salads meats sandwiches pre- packed salad meals olives nuts and crisps. It caters for short and long haul alike whatever the time between flights. There is a comprehensive range of wines spirits and soft drinks and very good coffee. There is also a separate restaurant for travellers on a night flight so that they can eat before their flight. The acoustics tend to echo a little but very good.,lounge
1176,Flew LHR-MAD-BOG: Saturday night connection through Madrid on 3 November. Lounge completely rammed no seats apart from a bar stool in the TV room. Food not surprisingly expired so a selection of boring dry savoury snacks. I forgot my BlackBerry charger and there were no charging stations. No wi-if amazes me every time I pass through Madrid it's 2012! Not a patch on Heathrow T5.,lounge
1177,To be clear there is a massive difference between the T4 and T4 South lounge so don't get them confused. T4 lounge is pleasant but the food and wine choice is poor. The decor is good and the toilets are trendy. Amazingly no wifi (what century are we in?). Computers seem to be powered by transistors. T4 South lounge great views friendly staff a wonderful red wine selection good food offering but again no wifi! Seating and general design good. For a business class lounge I would rate it 7/10.,lounge
1178,Lots of space many coffee points plenty of snacks relax lounges & showers are really good quality and super clean.,lounge
1179,Iberia lounges at MAD they have a sleeping room food and wines are respectable and Spanish the facility feels fresh and modern with some sense of design. They do however fail on one point which is that they are incredibly difficult to find the signage at MAD is terrible very confusing. Iberia staff seem to loathe English - the man who admitted me to the lounge looked pained by the act of speaking in English. This theme continued onboard in the business class cabin to LAX and no one but the purser will speak any language but Spanish - on a nonstop serving Los Angeles.,lounge
1180,Iberia offers a good quality lounge. Food service during breakfast lunch and restaurant for night flights. The rest of the day light snacks sandwiches and soft drinks/spirits. They offer a desk to try and learn about their wines of the month. The only problem no wifi only cable connection. Toilets showers in good condition. Also a rest area if you need some sleep.,lounge
1181,Before our outbound flight we used the lounge in T4S. This was a pleasant place with several defined areas. Very light and bright with views across the airport. It was a busy time of day with many long- haul flights departing but there was plenty of room. A good selection of hot and cold food as well as drinks. The only thing I noticed lacking were the toilets - too few and not to the same standard as other OneWorld carriers. On our return we used the lounge in T4. This seemed smaller but was still comfortable with a couple of unusual water features and views of the airport especially the impressive terminal roof structure. The food and beverage selection was noticeably more limited than in the T4S lounge. We made use of the shower facilities which were very good apart from the fact that the hot water lasted for 1 minute. When I queried this the attendant informed me that the boiler was unable to cope when all 6 showers were working at the same time. A slight design flaw.,lounge
1182,Very large lounge which spans a portion of the length of T4S with great views onto the runway. Great selection of spirits wines and beverages generally. Hot and cold food (including smoked salmon) cereals fresh fruits and various nibbles. Not too busy comfy seats and internet facilities.,lounge
1183,The lounge although it has been recently renovated seems to be very small on peak periods. The staff is almost invisible. The available food depends on the time of the day but sometimes everything is empty and nobody cares. The bathrooms are very small and if you decide to go to the WC you should keep dancing all the time since the light detector will turn off the lights if there is no movement.,lounge
1184,I used this lounge as travelling on a BA flight. First of all It takes about half hours to arrive to the lounge as T4 Barajas is not a user friendly airport. The lounge is very spacious nice design fantastic view on apron and mountains the selection of food would have been decent if the trays had any food on it the wine bar would have been nice if more wine bottles were available to the public (we had to ask the staff to open a few as there were none left open). The computer area is just ok nothing much the relaxation room is perfecft for passenger who like that. There is a restaurant for intercontinental passenger but this is closed until late at night. Toilets and showers good. The reception staff was welcoming and helpful the rest of staff seemed to be very lazy.,lounge
1185,Very quiet comfortable seating but a bit dark. Plenty of reading material OK drinks selection but no real food cookies and nuts. Secluded and not unpleasant though. No free internet access.,lounge
1186,VIP Sala lounge again disappoints. The general condition of the lounge is still average with a large seating area and a view (albeit obscured) across the runway. Some of the furniture is worn especially the chairs in the popular locations (near the windows). The TV despite being a large LCD is never really utilised - being tucked away in a corner on channel TVEspana without sound. When I asked to hear the TV (the normal lounge lady wasn't on duty today) the new lounge staff didn't speak English so I had to convert to Spanish. My Spanish is pretty good but I do expect the airport staff - especially lounge staff - to understand English and respond to me in that language if that is the language of my choice. It didn't set us on the right footing. I was told that sound would disturb others so she couldn't change the volume. So what is the point of the TV then? I asked. I got shrugged shoulders. I expressed my displeasure and walked off for a coffee. The coffee was cold. So I went back to the lounge staff. She solved the situation by taking my coffee to the kitchen and (I assume) putting it in the microwave. The cup was too hot to hold! Despite the coffee the bar/alcoholic drinks selection is superb. Even the soft drinks shine bright - Coke without caffeine Coke zero Fanta milkshakes fruit juices etc. all being stocked among the usual collection. By far the best collection of cold drinks in one lounge I've seen. However the food is dire. In fact it could be described as peanuts. Not even an apple or a rotting banana. Nothing except peanuts and a tea-biscuit. Compare this to the Sala lounge at TFN a smaller more regional airport serving mostly national Spanish routes and Tenerife North wins hands down. They even have small sandwiches and a selection of cakes at TFN - but in LPA no!,lounge
1187,A lovely lounge very spacious. Good range of food and drinks available. Wonderful views across to the mountains. Staff friendly and helpful.,lounge
1188,"Clean spacious light airy and very comfortable lounge with fantastic views across the apron and on to the snow peaked sierra. Awful catering : at 10.30am a few ""bollos"" - sticky buns some under ripe apples and some packet canape bases but nothing on them! Where were all the delicious things that the Spanish usually do so well for breakfast/mid morning snacks; not to mention something more substantial for passengers having transferred to Barajas through several time zones with body clocks after something resembling lunch or dinner? Staff offhand and indifferent.",lounge
1189,A pleasant open space with comfortable chairs and amenities (washroom etc) but lacking in substance. Catering non-existent coffee cold stale biscuits no internet. Staff tried to be helpful but English poor. Altogether disappointing.,lounge
1190,What a disappointment. Used this lounge prior to my morning flight to Madrid. Staff member at the front desk hardly acknowledge you as you walked in. Food selection was extremely poor nothing more than some stale croissants and some pre packaged mini muffins. Coffee from the machine was horrible. The two computer terminals were both out of order and so were the toilets. Does anything work in this lounge? Lounge was not used much by many of the travellers despite IB having numerous flights leaving around the early morning departure time at LHR perhaps the frequent travellers knew better than to waste their time.,lounge
1191,Used the Iberia business lounge at Frankfurt for their code-share Air Nostrum flights out of Frankfurt. Nice welcome and a good selection of magazines and drinks. I cannot quite get used to the largely European practice of having most washrooms separate from the lounge. At Frankfurt this meant a long precarious walk through an area of terminal refurbishment to a fairly crummy toilet. Surely it would be a good idea to equip business lounges with washrooms! Otherwise an odd little lounge but a reasonably pleasant overall experience and a place one could work.,lounge
1192,An excellent out of the way lounge. Warm greetings from all staff including the cleaners. Lockers with a key are provided for carry on luggage which offers a hands-free exploring of the lounge itself. Plenty of selection: sandwiches smoked salmon cheeses crackers chips as well as liquors wines and beer. Soft drinks water and juices are also available. Seating is very comfortable and widely accessible washrooms are nearby and were VERY clean. Way better than Air Canada's lounge.,lounge
1193,Visited this lounge on a Sunday afternoon - almost deserted. Comfortable seating and spacious airy atmosphere. No catering to speak of and poor drinks selection. Nothing to read either. Ok place for a bit of peace and quiet but otherwise very dull.,lounge
1194,An excellent lounge with all imaginable amenities a silent room with sleeping possibility huge space a restaurant for intercontinental passengers who can dine after 9 pm (which could be earlier I know Spanish people eat late but not everybody does) a wine tasting corner shower possibilities (great) separate smoking areas etc. Only wireless internet could be also free of charge.,lounge
1195,Yet again after visiting the Iberia Sala VIP lounge at Barcelona airport it seems that nobody works there. After arriving in the lounge tables were overflowing with all sorts of rubbish glasses were not cleared for couple of hours lounge was full of smoke. One of the fridges which was not working 6 months ago when I was last in this lounge was still not working this time.,lounge
1196,"Lounge itself is nice. However travelers should be aware that access is denied if they are arriving (even having paid in full for a business class ticket) unless their connection is the same day. This in spite of advertising that suggests otherwise. Icelandair's own ""access rules"" website simply says traveling on Saga or Economy plus which is not the case. Icelandair will deny you arrival access. The chance for a cup of coffee internet access and a shower is not available for those not transferring same day.",lounge
1197,The lounge is accessed via a lift from the man concourse. My flight time was 4:30pm so I arrived after lunch. The staff were very friendly a good choice of drinks and excellent selection of cold food was available rather like a smorgasbord together with sandwiches and cakes plus chocolates. The lounge had TV's and daily worldwide newspapers. The seating was comfortable and the decor good and airy. Bathroom facilities ok. Free wifi accessed by a password provided on each table.,lounge
1198,Fresh lounge with good basic facilities. The light breakfast offered on my visit was more than adequate. All staff were polite and helpful. The shower a big plus in itself when traveling overnight and bathroom facilities clean and pleasant.,lounge
1199,This lounge is one of the best I have been in. You get a locker and key to leave your luggage in if you want to sit quietly and read. Food was excellent and a great variety to choose from. Drinks were also good and lots of choice. Staff were really friendly and helpful. This lounge has lots of Icelandair pictures hung on the walls and it feels warm and inviting. Such a difference from the lounge they use in Boston.,lounge
1200,The lounge was fairly easy to find once past passport control. Staff very welcoming lounge is tastefully designed and overlooking the tarmac which means ample lighting and feeling of openness. Free wifi available and fast and steady. Plenty of seating. The lounge is split into two levels upper level for dining lower level for tea coffee and snacks. Very clean bathroom and shower facilities plentiful. I was disappointed with the lack of food selections some sandwiches rice beef curry and spicy bean curd dish available. Okay selection of drinks and alcohol. I was disappointed by the lack of sweets and desserts only cookies nuts and bite-size cheese available. It is obvious to see Japan Airlines is trying to cut cost.,lounge
1201,Very early departure on BA back to Heathrow. Got there about 0510! Watched sunrise and had some lovely strawberries. Departure delayed 45 mins so as we were travelling First we went next door to First lounge which opened at 0600. Nice peaceful surroundings and a short hop to the departure gate. Very pleasant all round.,lounge
1202,One of the best lounges I have been in. I managed to get a 1hr nap in a private cubicle with a bed followed by food and drinks in the restaurant area. This was followed by a massage and nice hot shower.,lounge
1203,Lounge accessed as a Qantas Club member for flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Lounge located Pre- Security screening in Terminal D Space Frankfurt International. The Sakura Lounge is modestly large. Professionally welcomed by front desk staff. Lounge neat tidy well lit. Many seating options. for passengers travelling in groups of two four and individual travellers. Showers accessible small but functional. Towels provided. Toilets clean well maintained. A bar/ Soft drinks counter area is well stocked and with plenty of options. A small sign points to the 'Buffet' area. A small counter with two bowls one of cubed fetta cheese and olives. A small buffet hatch contained multiple small sandwiches of meats and cheeses. Modest. Cups glasses plates & attire quickly cleaned by a group of kitchen attendants. Flight information discreetly but well displayed in multiple areas of lounge. Announcements discreet and audible. Plenty of news papers in Japanese German and English. Light & airy well laid out professional staff. Furnishings looking slightly worn.,lounge
1204,Great little lounge extremely polite helpful staff good drink selection. Spa and shower are good and functional.,lounge
1205,This is the worst business class lounge I have ever been in. The drink selection is poor and only a few cookies for food. It is extremely small and the no smoking area wreaked of smoke. It is more comfortable sitting at the gate. At least by the gate you aren't subjected to second hand smoke.,lounge
1206,Flew Qantas San Francisco to Sydney. Apparently Qantas uses the JAL lounge rather than the BA for some reason. The Lounge was absolutely packed very small rooms little to eat or drink apart from chips. It was so depressing that I had to leave. Minimal staff not helpful. Very disappointing when a 14hr+ flight is ahead of you!,lounge
1207,Two first class lounge at Terminal 2 easy to find dinning area but no restaurant service. Quality of food okay but not outstanding mainly Japanese food. good range of drinks. Staff tried to speak English but really difficult to understand. Wifi service and wired computer available. Spa services only have massage for 10 minutes.,lounge
1208,Very small but a haven of peace as they restrict it only To First Class passengers much to the annoyance of OneWorld Emerald members. Food offering poor and no champagne but polite service and free internet.,lounge
1209,Although crowded at peak times this is a wonderful lounge. Very friendly and polite staff always looking to help. Great choice of Japanese and Western food and drinks. Only criticism would be small number of restrooms for such a big facility.,lounge
1210,Beautiful lounge with spa like shower rooms available. Complimentary massage was just the topping on the cake. Plentiful buffet and open bar (believe there's a bartender in the afternoon). All staff was absolutely gracious and accomodating. It seemed to be extremely crowded in the morning as we were unable to find two lounge chairs together.,lounge
1211,This lounge is for business class premium economy class and their premier class passengers. The first class passengers have a separate one I believe. This lounge was large covering two floors. On the upper floor there is a buffet. Yes an honest to god buffet of food not just packaged snacks. Great offerings of both hot and cold dishes and plenty of seating. As always children annoy me. Why and how do they get into places like this? Their running around and screaming a real turn off.,lounge
1212,Good view of apron - convenient for gates for intercontinental flights. Nice breakfast includig Japanese choices and eggs/sausage etc changing to lunch at 1100 - plenty of choice fabulous beef curry! Free massages etc. Didn't feel crowded. Remarkable beer machine with automatic tilting to get perfect head.,lounge
1213,The lounge is somewhat small and rather crowded with business travelers. However they have a nice supply of traditional Japanese snacks (rice wrapped in seaweed for example) and a good spread of tea sodas beer and cocktails. Definitely nicer than many domestic American lounges though not luxurious.,lounge
1214,Light and airy with views over the apron - a good lounge. Complimentary massage service. Range of food in service a little narrow but tasty. Self service bar coffees soft drinks etc. Enough computer and printing terminals. Separate smoking room so main lounge remains smoke free. Not as good as Malaysia's KL Business lounge.,lounge
1215,Small lounge overlooking apron with just enough seating for a 2/3 full business cabin. Beverage and snack range quite small - a choice of red or white wine beer juices soft drinks and tea/coffee. For morning flight sandwiches pastries and some sushi were available. Washrooms very small with few amenities - not even a toothbrush or razor. LAN network available for laptops etc. A reasonable quiet spot away from the hubub of Sydney's international terminal shops. Disappointed that was not advised to stay in lounge but to board plane when departure was delayed 90 minutes due to plane's mechanical problems.,lounge
1216,Was very pleasantly surprised by the new Sakura Business Lounge in Terminal 2 at Narita Airport. Such an improvement over the previous one. All the necessary amenities were available including a good selection of drinks and snacks reading material and then hot foods and salad offered on an upper level. The lounge is attractively decorated open and spacious with lots of windows. The seating was comfortable and washrooms well maintained. It is one of the better business lounges I have been in over the past few years. Definitely a place you don't mind spending any number of hrs. in before a long flight.,lounge
1217,The new Sakura Lounge is a significant improvement on the old one. It is now equipped with truly awesome shower studios and complimentary shiatsu massage facilities. Wi-fi access is also complimentary and there is a large business corner with ample supply of desktop PC's. The mezzanine level also offers excellent hot food catering. Bar facilities offer an average choice of drinks. Seating in the lounge is very comfortable and spacious. Overall this lounge is now up to the standards of its competitors.,lounge
1218,Air New Zealand uses JAL international lounge in Osaka. Found the lounge very basic. Very limited choice of drinks and the food was nuts and cookies! Nothing else. Seats arranged in long rows all facing the same way. Not very welcoming or relaxing. Staff essentially not present.,lounge
1219,This Business lounge is very small. Located on the 2nd floor after the immigration. In an afternoon is overcrowded and you often have to share your table with fellow passengers. Beverages selection is limited but sufficient for short inter north asia flights : coffee/tea soft drinks juices and a few alcoholic drinks (mostly beer). Food is very limited too : They have only japanese cake that are packed individually plus the nuts and cracker to match up when drinking beer. They are serving wraps from subway. I would love to have some japanese food like sushi or noodles. Lavatories are clean no shower. A separate meeting room is available plus copier machine is also available for use. Free internet access if you have your own laptop. No PC terminal available. Most of the reading materials are in Japanese.,lounge
1220,This Business lounge is OK. Located on the 3rd floor after the immigration. In the evening is overcrowded and you often have to share your table with fellow passengers. Most passengers are waiting for their intra-US flights. Beverages selection is limited but sufficient for long haul flight and as a main hub in asia: coffee/tea soft drinks juices and a few alcoholic drinks (mostly beer). Food is very limited too : They have only japanese cake that are packed individually plus the nuts and crakers to match up when drinking beer. I would love to have some japanese food like sushi or noodles. Lavatories are clean no shower. A 15 minutes shoulder and neck massage for free is available from the afternoon till 8pm but you need to register. A separate meeting room is available plus copier machine is also available for use. Free internet access if you have your own laptop there is a separate room for people who wants to use their laptops. No PC terminal available. The lounge has its irish pub style corner where you can mingle with other guest.,lounge
1221,"Disgusting. This can't even be called a lounge. Next time I was at the airport (July 2015) I did not even visit it. Also the staff is rude and inefficient. Better not to have this lounge as it is used by all airlines, and it actually is a misrepresentation of the airline, or card company offering access.",lounge
1222,"Service was good but the lounge becomes very busy as many flight arrive and transit at the same time. Good food and drink choices. Seats are comfortable. Showers are good, but one has to wait as so many people were in queue.",lounge
1223,This is an excellently maintained lounge. Good food and great ambience thereby providing great customer experience. Keep up the good work!,lounge
1224,The shared airline lounge at the new international terminal in Mumbai was excellent. Elevator down one level after you enter the reception lobby to the business class lounge area. Plenty of comfortable seating in a variety of configurations lounge chairs sofas eating tables with chairs and work stations with outlets. The free WiFi was reliable and fast but the logon process is a little tricky. Separate food bar and lounge areas. The food area had a very comprehensive buffet both Western and Indian food one of the best I have seen second only to Dubai. Lots of snacks and fruit which you could take with you for your flight. The bar had a full wall video screen showing sports and a wide selection of beer wine and cocktails. There were also private work rooms for business calls and shower facilities.,lounge
1225,We took a Jet Airways domestic flight from Kolkata Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport (CCU) to Delhi (DEL) in business class. At check in we received an invitation to visit the lounge. Lounge was a complete disappointment. Apart of coffee/tea and soft drinks you had to pay for drinks! I’m a Star Alliance Gold member and visited lots of lounges everywhere but paying for drinks when you already pay the premium for flying business class is just unbelievable! I never had this experience before. Food options were very limited as well and for western style food the only option was Danish butter cookies… (Indian style food wasn’t much neither). Overall appearance of the lounge was rather filthy and not worth a visit.,lounge
1226,"Early morning use of the Aspire Lounge at Newcastle. Good service from staff, a little slow to check in but nothing to bad. Bacon sandwiches very good, but no Irish whiskey of any cider of any type. Come on Aspire, its not much to ask is it!",lounge
1227,The opening of the new Terminal area includes the new Simba and Pride Lounges (I saw both). The new lounges are world class with great food and beverage options (excellent wines) WIFI varied seating areas including quiet business & TV lounge areas and shower rooms. These lounges are a wonderful refuge before a long flight and service was excellent! This was a huge change from previous years flights from NBO.,lounge
1228,"Intolerable noise levels. Constant ringing of some bell for unclear reason, frequent overheads. Frantic atmosphere. No chance of getting a shower. Food is minimal, though not bad what little there is. WiFi a bit sketchy. Bathroom looked like a warzone, used towels everywhere, hadn't been tidied up in quite a while. Inadequate facilities.",lounge
1229,"Longe was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Tasty food and drink was served enough. Staff often clean our table and the restrooms.",lounge
1230,Just brutal. I had a 2 hour layover on my flight from YYC-JNB. I desperately needed a shower so went to this lounge which was miles from my gate. KLM staff were rude and refused to acknowledge my existence. I finally figured out the number system for the shower. Got 65 and they were on something under 30. The lounge was crowded and noisy. I bailed without my shower and didn't even bother with the aggravation on the return trip and made do with wet wipes in the public bathroom. Not what I expected from a Business Class lounge.,lounge
1231,"This is the worst ""Business Class"" lounge I have been in by a country mile. In fact calling it a lounge is a joke. It's full to capacity some people going straight back out because there aren't enough seats and only 1 or 2 charging points to fight over the décor is tired and dated. The toilets are absolutely disgusting I walked in then straight out to find some others in the Airport. No wonder they hide this facility down one of the gates and barely signpost it it really is that embarrassing. Most lounges offer easy access Wifi if you fight your way through all the mobile registration palava you're rewarded with a temperamental and incredibly slow service presumably due to the volume of users. Come on KLM you have to do better than this.",lounge
1232,Great lounge lots of seating areas good selection to eat and drink. Wi Fi great with no problems staff very good and clean shower toilet areas.,lounge
1233,"Had high expectations as my family provided solid praise from their visit a few years ago. Was not disappointed. It's not a ""huge"" place but enough room for all on a Saturday afternoon dealing with a variety of flights. The self-serve drinks were varied and adequate the food skewed a bit to Asian spicy (for China Airlines pax?) and the seating comfortable and varied. A nice view of the apron & planes to boot. The only downside was the staffer on desk duty who was quite perplexed on how to deal with our Diner's Club cards had to ask in the back and in the end (as per my statement) I was charged for 3 guests instead of 3 free card admissions. (now under dispute for a refund). Ironically we were flying KLM and ran into a rather rude KLM staffer who was flogging $35 passes to all & sundry in the check-in area. Said our DC cards would not get us in. (yes they do that lounge desk girl not withstanding). That being said the guest rate for Diner's is only usd$28 or about cad$30. For about the same you can get into the Plaza Premium lounge right across the hall from Crown. However I do recommend it just try to maximize your time there.",lounge
1234,We needed to wait for close to four hours as the shopping centre next to the airport turned out to be closed. At Athens international airport KLM uses the Goldair lounge. The lounge offers comfortable chairs and provides good views of the runway but also the car rental centre. Wifi is provided for free but didn't work that well. There are desktop computers available as well as power sockets to charge your devices. What was disappointing was the lack of a shower / changing room (although the toilets were spacious) and the assortment of food was questionable. All in all not a bad experience but nothing like the KLM / Air France operated lounges. We saw that Lufthansa does operate their own lounge at Athens by the way.,lounge
1235,The KLM/AF lounge is located adjacent to the international boarding gates in terminal D. It can be accessed from the other terminals as well via the inter-terminal train without having to go through security. The lounge is relative small but I have not seen it overcrowded in the two times I visited. The seating is comfortable with the same types of chairs as the KLM lounges in AMS. In the middle of the lounge is the food and beverage area. The food is better than the AMS lounges with sandwiches salads soup cookies and other snacks as well as soft drinks and liquor. The booze selection is better than you will find in domestic carrier lounges. It is all free and self serve. You make everything the way you like it and no bartender to tip. There are two TVs located t either end of the lounge. The staff will accommodate your channel requests. There are boarding announcements and the gates are 60 seconds or less away. So you can remain in the sanctuary of the lounge until just before stepping on the plane. It would be nice if they added a shower. The restrooms are clean and adequate in number.,lounge
1236,Would recommend this lounge came with all the fixings loads of snacks (great variety too) and drinks. Lounge access was only $35 and well worth it great option instead of paying for airport dinner.,lounge
1237,Nice surroundings comfortable chairs good connections good food and drinks (but limited choice). Can be crowded at times because so many partner airlines may use it as well. Well kept toilet area and shower facilities. A good start towards a long flight.,lounge
1238,If you're flying out of Dammam this is the only lounge in town and it's marginally better than hanging out in the gate area at a coffee shop or the soon to be completed Cinnabon. Service in the lounge is almost non-existent and food selection is hit or miss -- sometimes there was dismal food but no plates to put it on other times there were marginally edible hot dishes (for example: rice a kind of chicken stew some really boring sauteed vegetables). There were not-very-tempting pastries in plastic wrap; maybe they were better than they looked but I didn't give them a try. There's no alcohol because you're in Saudi Arabia; you can get coffee tea soft drinks and faux juice drinks. I couldn't get WiFi and couldn't find anyplace where I could comfortably use a laptop anyway.,lounge
1239,We had a long layover at Muscat so decided to crash at Oman Air Business Lounge. Great clean full facilities and food. Have great separate area for sleeping. Biggest problem was noises made by loud staff throwing dishes and they started vacuuming at 2am.,lounge
1240,Lounge is open since may 2013 located on the first floor. The lounge is small and has a variety of drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic and breads/croissants. There is wifi (the cloud) and a tv with danish channels. For this small airport the lounge is in my opinion sufficient.,lounge
1241,A fairly large lounge plenty of space and wifi. Food choice poor and quality not up to much. Was very disappointing. Being a smoker the only saving grace was the smoking room in the lounge.,lounge
1242,Why bother the lounge is so small only sandwiches a few random spirits no toilet/shower in the lounge. Go to the Air France lounge a few meters away.,lounge
1243,One of the worst lounges they fill it up until there is no space left food is too basic no shower facilities as part of the entry you have to pay extra. And the service is quite bad.,lounge
1244,The worst lounge? Like Air France Business Class Lounge in Paris CDG KLM clearly take the view that business class passengers are just a nuisance. The lounge is just row upon row of tired seating. The food is awful and wine undrinkable. Sad to say having just achieved gold status on Flying Blue (by accident!) I will probably have to use it again but I will want to eat elsewhere. And the staff have zero interest in passengers. Finally the washroom was filthy and smelt really bad. The one redeeming feature the WiFi copes will despite the constant overcrowding.,lounge
1245,Not my first time in this lounge and it has nicely improved for those who remember the previous lounge. Food quality receives an average score. Drinks as much as you want. Cleaning and cooking staff should work faster as many plates of food remained empty too long and many empty plates and glasses remained too long where nobody was sitting. Staff are polite and helpful. Showers and lavatories are clean and comfortable showers can be very busy at peak hours. Seats are comfortable and give you a nice view of airport. If there would be some more tvs and some reading material such as international news papers this lounge would receive a better note.,lounge
1246,Tiny lounge for KLM and Air France. In the evening when both flights to Amsterdam and Paris leave within 10mins of each other people were standing around. Very warm poor selection of food. One drinks machine and slow internet. I left soon after and went to main terminal to get more space and air.,lounge
1247,The lounge is nice with ample room. The choices of bevarages and food/snacks are OK. Cleanliness is somewhat debatable as the gents toilets were dirty and with an unpleasant smell. But the policy of internet access was really annoying - you get 30 mins free acess - and that's it. When I asked for another acess card I was rather impolitely told that there were only one per customer! Arguably you could use your mobile with tethering but that's also expensive. A better plan for wifi access would be a nice touch.,lounge
1248,I have used this lounge for KLM flights to and fro from Kuala Lumpur to Chicago. The lounge is big and spreads out. You can find a comfortable spot. There is a quiet room for those who prefer a nap. The food is not that great so best to have meals outside the lounge.,lounge
1249,Best thing to say about KLM lounges in Scriphol is that they are big. Most other services are mediocre. Biggest of all concerns is the attitude with most of the staff servicing customers : they are constantly sipping coffee and tea which they serve themselves from the same place as customers. When it comes to service they are usually short rude and inconsistent (between staff and the two lounges in the airport). I have been coming in the KLM lounges for well over five years and this is a repeated observation.,lounge
1250,Visited the KLM Crown Lounge en route between Manchester and Taipei. First visit was 6pm in the evening and the lounge was quiet with plenty of choice of seats excellent choice of food and drink and fast wifi. On the way back we arrived at 7am and the lounge was far busier but the choice of food for breakfast items was still very comprehensive although the Wifi seemed a bit slower. I took advantage of the complimentary shower facilities but had to wait over an hour for my slot as it was so busy but as we had a long lay over it was no issue for me.,lounge
1251,Morning visit before my connection to FRA. Very large clean and new looking lounge full breakfast bar hot and cold food and drinks. WIFI was available but didn't have time to use it.,lounge
1252,This terminal was under construction while I was there. Its located up stairs and you have to go out of the secure area. Roomy lounge and not crowded with nice view comfortable seating cold/warm food and lots of drinks of all kinds. 30 min before the boarding time a KLM rep came to escort all passengers to the security point and made it to the gate few min just before boarding and all went very well.,lounge
1253,I arrived for a mid-morning flight and huge lounge was packed out. The food and drink area was in a circular design to handle the hordes but food was not of particularly good quality and the lounge didn't have a feeling of exclusivity. Much more food on offer out in the terminal itself. Only good point was free wifi and a free drink.,lounge
1254,Not impressed with this lounge. At breakfast it was packed to the brim with passengers and the food on offer was very limited. Old computers tired furniture and a hectic atmosphere made me think it would be better to just go outside to one of the many concessions. No elite feeling whatsoever.,lounge
1255,This was my first experience with my Priority Pass and I have to say I was very disappointed. Although this is a very small Airport the lounge was no more than a few couches and a magazine or two no Internet Access was available and the snacks were crackers or cookies in a package along with soda and water. This was all you received for $27 per person! I let Priority Pass know as soon as I arrived home and their response was sorry. In reading some other reviews it seems there are no standard levels of service with the lounges although they all charge the same price for access. I am sure there are some very nice lounges to offset the ones like I experienced perhaps a rating system would help prevent someone from experiencing what I did.,lounge
1256,KLM Crown Lounge is very large. You might find yourself walking quite a distance to reach depending on which gate you are departing from. The front desk staff are friendly and the wifi log in details are displayed at the desk. The seats are comfortable and have plug outlets. The food is actually pretty good. During lunch/dinner time you can get fried rice with chicken curry. For breakfast they serve a lot of pastries and other stuff. They have a large restroom inside the lounge as well as a business center where you can use the complimentary computers.,lounge
1257,This is the lounge KLM inflicts upon it's business class passengers (not operated by KLM). It's small with dated decor. There is only one toilet cubicle for each sex. Food looked very ordinary. No wine. So bad I left and went to the bar opposite - so I could at least still use the free wifi. Please KLM - do a deal with Malaysian Airlines for your passengers to use their lounge. They're your codeshare partner in this part of the world!,lounge
1258,KLM/Air France Business Class Lounge in Johannesburg was dirty uncomfortable and shabby. I had the impression that it is the old Virgin Atlantic Lounge KLM/Air France took over the old lounge and that was it. They might think it is not necessary to renovate the place but at the moment it is not the standard of KLM/Air France. During my stay my table was never cleared of glasses or plates. There was nobody to clean the place or to take care of anything.,lounge
1259,One of the worst lounges I have ever been to. Even the ones at Heathrow that you can pay for which the airlines do not provide are much better than this one.,lounge
1260,KLM crown lounge in AMS is far below its sister lounge in CDG. Little food to eat it was lunch time and poor quality of drinks. My seven year old son was charged 45e to be able to get inside the lounge whereas he got in for free at Paris. So I paid 45e so that he could drink a glass of water and have some crackers. KLM staff is rough in the air and on the ground.,lounge
1261,Lounge huge with a nice assortment of snacks and drinks and there was a nice beef bourgignon on offer. Plenty of newspapers free WiFi but not the best speed. Staff friendly.,lounge
1262,Crown lounge near gates B. Very clean and adequate shower cubicles. Had a few drinks and nibbles from the bar broad choice of newspapers. Very good lounge stylish with plenty of corners and areas to suit mood or privacy.,lounge
1263,Probably one of the dirtiest lounge I have ever visited: stained carpet greasy windows. The choice of food is very limited and of industrial quality. Choice of alcohol is minimal. On the upside nice view on the runway and fast wifi.,lounge
1264,To say we were disappointed and underwhelmed with this lounge is an understatment. Incheon is a huge airport and so the lounge is necessarily huge too although it is cleverly set up is two areas separated by the lift shafts toilets etc. Comfortable chairs everywhere but largely lined up as if in a waiting room. Fantastic views from massive glass onto the tarmac apron. The catering was astonishing in its pausity. One unrermakable red and one unknown (and don't care too) white no bubbles of any sort a couple of self-serve draft beers water came in juice pouch things reminiscent of 1990s economy class meal trays. There was a non-descript pumpkin soup without bread a couple of unappetising salads a couple of pot noodle things (self-serve) a couple of juices and thats about your lot. Empty glasses and plates hung around for a long time including a beer mug on a table that was there when we wrrived and was still there when we left 2 hours later. Toilets were roomy and clean a must-visit to have a play with the electric flush bidet and warm air arrangement. Wifi free without the need of a password and was quick enough for the few emails and bit of browning I did. Will be transiting through Incheon in a couple of weeks on way home but don't think we'll bother going to this lounge at all.,lounge
1265,Large lounge with a variety of seating options and a nice view of the tarmac. I visited on two occasions late at night and early in the morning. Food options at that time were limited with only a few eastern and western choices which were hard to assemble into a coherent dinner or breakfast. Wine and spirits were available at both times. Only prepacked cups of water were available - bottles of water would be better. The shower facilities were clean and spacious but there was a 20 minute wait for a shower early in the morning despite the lounge not being full. Overall a satisfactory space though not exceptional.,lounge
1266,"A large open plan lounge which feels light and airy but very functional. Seats are comfortable with light and power at the vast majority. The selection of food was limited to nibbles/snacks - snack biscuits cheese cubes cheery tomatoes and soup. Not a great deal else - no sandwiches. Wine selection was good Heineken beer on tap and a range of standard quality spirits were on offer. Wifi was free however required you to reconfigure your mailbox if you wished to send emails. An enclosed entertainment area playing news channels made up the centre piece of the lounge washrooms were clean and tidy. The downside of the lounge was that there seemed to be a lack of staff clearing away such a large area resulting in a number of tables having ""leftovers"" on them for a considerable periods of time.",lounge
1267,The lounge is not that bad once you get past the very inconsistent service agents. This time I was refused lounge access as although being a Platinum for life I had a boarding pass for Turkish Airlines!,lounge
1268,Used both Schengen and 52 lounge - great improvement over last time I used them - they have been refurbished. Free WiFi was very welcome. Good selection of self service drinks - snacks very limited. A good place to spend an hour of so waiting for your next flight.,lounge
1269,Used this lounge as Aeroflot passenger. It was dirty and crowded. There was no food accept for few crackers and some cheese. Plenty of soft drinks that were restocked fast. The communication between the plane and the lounge was terrible. We were asked to proceed to boarding and the plane was nowhere near ready! The receptionist was very clueless. We ended up waiting in line in front of the gate for 30 min Overall a pretty depressing experience.,lounge
1270,"After a six hour flight from Singapore to Incheon in Prestige Class we attempted to use the Prestige Lounge to freshen up before our 8 hour layover. We were denied access stating that it was against policy. I spoke with a very polite supervisor who could not understand why we would want to use their lounge if we were not continuing on with them. When I explained that KE does not fly to San Antonio they could not care less. Thankfully AA has a contract with Asiana where the first class lounge was clean comfortable and well equipped. Next time I want to spend US$5000 between ICN and SIN you can be sure I will remember and inform KE that it is not in ""my policy"" to waste money on a carrier who only cares about you until you cross the airplane threshold.",lounge
1271,Crowded lounge with good drinks selection and meagre snacks. Overall plastic and cheap-feel to it compared to AF or EK lounges in Dubai. Still a welcome haven from the crowded Dubai airport main lounges.,lounge
1272,This lounge is shared by several airlines and was a pretty poor show. The lounge was really congested and there were not enough seats for all the passengers. Our flight was delayed so we spent even longer in there than planned. The front desk staff were pleasant but they chatted to one another non stop about another member of staff. As I was seated beside them I could not help but overhear. Not very professional!,lounge
1273,A very underwhelming business class lounge. food selection and quality is mediocre it is always busy and the toilets and shower rooms are boiling hot. What use is it to take a shower only to sweat through a shirt before you leave the shower room? At first I thought it was just me because I overheat easily but watching other passengers leave the shower area they were all red faced and sweating. Then there's the obvious issues with cleanliness the showers I've used have all had mould there is no shower curtain so the water splashes out onto your luggage and all over the floor. Add to that no wash cloths one towel and no floor mat and it is an entirely unpleasant experience. I've given them a few opportunities but from here on out I'm just going to go without a shower; remaining dirty is preferable to using these facilities. Then there's the staff on every occasion I've been to this lounge some KLM employees are courteous but most are dismissive rude and not the least bit interested in customer satisfaction. KLM service has been falling steadily over the years and it is apparent that things are near a breaking point as obvious budget cuts and lack of planning/staff training for non-aircraft positions doesn't rank more than a single star. On a plus side there is wi-fi I am using to write this!,lounge
1274,I cannot follow to my former writers who recommended this Lounge. No choice of food no bottles of water or coke just glasses. Crowded! Impossible from KE to allocate this Lounge for full paying Business-Guests.,lounge
1275,There are two KE business class lounges at ICN. The larger and more plush lounge is located in the passenger terminal immediately past security. Both lounge areas have the same food and drinks but the one on the right is usually less crowded. The food is simple but more substantial than in most US airline lounges wine and liquor selections adequate. The shower facilities are located adjacent to this section of the lounge - clean and everything you need to refresh. The other lounge is on the concourse that serves foreign carriers like Delta and Skyteam flights. This lounge is smaller and is generally more stark and less comfortable. The food and drinks are the same. There are several smaller rooms at the back of the lounge that have TVs and comfortable seating. They are usually empty or have only one or two other passengers. English channels are available for catching up on current events. Neither lounge can issue boarding passes or change seats.,lounge
1276,I had a guest pass before by ICN-BKK flight and arrived with around 6 hours to spend in the lounge. Most travelers go to the left from the desk and that side of the lounge is full of people. If you pass the showers on the right there is an area with the same food and beverage offerings but less people. I was there all day the food stayed the same - standard hotel buffet. Nothing super special but filling. The bar was self serve beer wine whisky scotch and Jack Daniels. My only complaint was the smoking room. I know most airports do not have this but in Korea they are extremely necessary. Many Koreans smoke and the tiny closet sized room was continually full to the point of no room to move. The bathrooms were a little dirty upon arrival but were cleaned after I left it.,lounge
1277,I was somewhat disappointed in the facilities of the business class lounge at Hong Kong airport. Was waiting to board A380 to Seoul but it was very bland lots of seats and a desk for internet. Food selection not interesting and attendant less than friendly. They really need to upgrade this lounge. Doesn't encourage one to think of Korean Air as a possibility for long haul flights.,lounge
1278,KAL Business (Prestige) lounge at Incheon Airport is far too small for the numbers of passengers using it. I passed through this lounge twice in a period of four weeks and it was very crowded both times. It is showing it age and is desperately in need of a face lift and a substantial increase in size. The food on offer was poor a couple of hot Korean dishes cheese nuts cakes and biscuits. Drinks were ok but not exciting. The shower rooms were good and kept very clean. The desk staff were not particularly friendly and would not even look at a request for a seat change on my next flight. No boarding calls made but I quite like that is it helps keep the noise level down monitor screens around the lounge enable passengers to see what is happening with their flight.,lounge
1279,This has to be the poorest Business Class (Prestige Class) lounge I have ever been in. It is too small and has no ambience at all. The food and drink selection was virtually non existant a few cakes and biscuits plus tea and coffee and a few cold drinks were all that was on offer and this was around noon waiting to board the A380 to Incheon. I didn't use the showers so I cannot comment on the quality or condition. The desk staff were ok and the cleaning staff did a good job of clearing up.,lounge
1280,This is really a very disappointing and bad experience. Basically the lounge has nothing to offer and can not be regarded as an intercontinental business class lounge. There is only one lounge worse than the intercontinental KAL lounge in Incheon; it is the intercontinental KAL lounge at JFK for the return flight on the A380. It smells of old tobacco the sofas are old and worn out. The choice of drinks and food is miserable the coffee is disgusting so are the muffins the rest offered is plastic cheese and some plastic sandwiches. Truly a disappointing experience!,lounge
1281,Sofas are very comfortable. Complimentary wifi food delicious but would be better if there were more choices. Same applies to beverages too. Newspapers available but only the ones printed in Korea Japan or China. No British American French or German newspapers available. Great view of tarmac from the lounge. Lounge is secluded from the public area so is very quiet. Very clean and nice toilets.,lounge
1282,Actually a very poor experience. The lounge itself was fair comfortable seating an ample drinks selection. If one wanted a hot drink one was confronted with a dispenser only labelled in Japanese/Korean staff quite unwilling to help. As there was no catering (only rice crackers and savoury crackers) for this just-after-lunchtime departure. This added to an unsatisfactory experience mostly on the account of the rude and unhelpful staff. I do not consider it a problem to have a limited command of English in a non-english speaking country and working in a mostly non-english speaking place but it is very problematic to combine this with such a rude attitude.,lounge
1283,A very pleasant experience and a good start for an overnight trip to Seoul. Lounge is on the way from check-in to gate. Very relaxed and spacious no outside windows. Drinks are made to order. Choice is a bit limited perhaps but the lounge staff are kind and enthusiastic. No meal service only peanuts crisps and the like. Each passenger was personally informed about when it was time to board.,lounge
1284,It's ok but not grand. Food selection limited. Beverages are good. Bathrooms are outside of lounge. Internet has always been very difficult when I come here. This time I was told to use Northwest connection which they said is better (and no password setup). They were right.,lounge
1285,Large lounge situated upstairs clearly signposted. Comfortable seating. Excellent food and drink - a wide range food changing according to hour. Obliging staff. Shower room I used was fine - large well-stocked. No internet terminals but several hook-up points and I the entire lounge wifi for those equipped with laptops. Magazine and newspaper provision a rather limited. No flights calls but several departure screens available.,lounge
1286,Very large business class concept lounge. Many seats in Asian fashion. Very dark minimal lighting overlooking runway. Small central food area with packaged cakes and cookies available various assortments of pot of noodles (the type where you add your own hot water). Small bar area with light beverages available coffee and tea - only three available alcoholic beverages ; Vodka Baileys and Red Wine. Large internet section about 12 computers available. Small smoking room in the corner with door standing room only. Not a very comfortable lounge. Its run by Air China and serves multiple airlines in comparison with the other lounges available in that airport this one is probably the most taty and messy looking. Carpet and upholstery on seats looked stained not a clean look.,lounge
1287,Very clinical looking lounge. However lots of space clean staff friendly. Used by a few airlines in the SkyTeam network. Lots of food available - from sandwiches to sushi to Chocolate Cake. Open bar and coffee machines. Not sure of internet area.,lounge
1288,Nice big lounge at Incheon airport solely for the use of Prestige Class Passengers. Took a while to find it though as no clear direction. Comfortable seating  a little bit clinical rather than homely feel. Staff Friendly only breakfast cereals and breads on offer at the time I was there  however still had a full bar service. Did not see any computers for internet browsing. Had a small smoking room which was comfortable with Plasma TV and away from the non smoking section.,lounge
1289,Nice lounge on the Upper floor. Spacious when I used it. Seating comfortable in groups of 4 chairs but a bit boring in layout - nice views out across runway etc. Staff very polite and obliging and will bring you drink or food to your table. Selection of foods a bit limited and would expect more in a nice F class lounge - drinks etc okay though. Shower rooms and relaxing area but found to be rather basic and short on normal F class lounge amenities. No boarding calls and staff do not check which passenger on what flight so had a real rush to boarding gate in the end.,lounge
1290,Very small lounge with no daylight no washrooms etc and full at time of use. Korean need to get something much better and bigger as this was horrid - the main T3 is better and more comfortable and that is Heathrow we are talking about. No proper selection of foods apart from nuts and crackers no internet or wireless and seating is cramped as they try to squash as many people in as possible. Nice staff who are polite and welcoming but otherwise this is a really poor standard of lounge.,lounge
1291,Run of the mill lounge good selection of newspapers basic food and drink. Wifi. Clean toilets.,lounge
1292,One of the best lounges I have come across. Spacious comfortable seating well stocked with day's newspapers and well stocked bar and food. Spotless toilets.,lounge
1293,A pretty poor Lounge. While the chairs were reasonably comfortable and the Lounge was clean the food quality and choice was very poor. Crisps and nuts were OK but the sandwiches were dried up with a very poor selection. I never discovered what was on the savoury biscuits. There were unlabelled jugs of coloured fluid - presumably drinks - and Coke/Fanta etc available from the bar. Alcoholic drinks were available at a charge. The computer I went to use wouldn't connect to the internet but someone from the front desk sorted it quickly.,lounge
1294,Awful. Why bother. The Lufthansa lounge 50 m is excellent. Why does LOT bother using this tired old lounge from Korean air where the choice of beverages is poor and the food frankly dreadful.,lounge
1295,The new LOT/ Star Alliance lounge is an excellent addition. Signage to the lounge can be a little confusing as one can end up in the “old” lounge on the main level. However after locating the lounge upstairs one is greeted in a very modern and open (no ceiling) environment with GOOD natural light. The lounge is not very large but IS comfortable. Free Wi-Fi is available not always available at many airport lounges.,lounge
1296,After passport & security control was difficult to find the right lounge - found the Polonez lounge after a while running around the airport. Nice small lounge in warm colours poor food and beverage assortment only some cold cuts and 2-3 kind of cheeses some olives vegetables nuts and chocolates.,lounge
1297,In WAW there are 3 lounges all with pretty much the same amenities. In the non-schengen area there is Bolero downstairs. Schengen T2 has Ballada which is pretty small it is much better to make the trek to T1 to use Preludium which is larger and far less busy and has a large screen TV. All lounges have a few internet terminals and wi-fi. Lounges have basic snacks as well as candy sandwiches and hot pasta in a cup bar with spirits wine and beer as well as soft drinks/water. There are plenty of international and Polish newspapers and magazines available. There are no showers.,lounge
1298,Lounge is operated by the airport. It's pretty basic. The lounges in Terminal 1 were nicer. Good selection of food and drink. Seating okay. Reading materials provided. Nothing special.,lounge
1299,"A warm welcome from Lufthansa Lounge Staff. Lounge is split into two sections, one larger for business and one smaller for first. It is one of my preferred lounges as it has a direct connect thru a door to the jet bridge of the plane. Food and wine is excellent for a lounge, where the seating area for first can improve. As first class passenger, you can order wine and food from a menu and get it served on your table. For business class there is a food and bar with different kind of warm and cold food available. I got my food served right on the boarding call and the ground staff gave me another 15 min to finish as we were good on time.  Overall great service.",lounge
1300,"A dignified and relaxing lounge, very attentive Lufthansa staff. Excellent DO&CO cuisine with buffet and a la carte dishes, dreamlike desserts.",lounge
1301,"This lounge is quite large, and at 10am the seating was adequate and varied with leather chairs, work stations, and eating counters. The food and beverage selections were ample and tasty. The most important aspect however was the Lufthansa staff. There was a major problem with my reservation and ticket that didn't become apparent until after check-in, security, and passport control. When I went on-line to see if the adjacent seat was still open, I discovered that my assigned seat showed as unoccupied. The Lufthansa staff in the lounge spent 30 minutes calling back and forth to various United Airlines agents to resolve the problem. I will be eternally grateful to this staff and to Lufthansa in general. If I we're mean and petty, I would complain that this lounge is located in an interior space and offers no view of tarmac or runway. Nevertheless, if the situation boils down to viewing airplanes or getting to board a plane on which you thought you had a confirmed seat, I will go with the latter. Kudos and a thousand thanks to Lufthansa.",lounge
1302,I cannot understand why Lufthansa use this lounge - shared by a lot of companies it is a very umpleasant place. Not very clean with an extremely poor choice of drinks and food. The soft drinks in the fridge were not chilled. Staff unfriendly and slow service.,lounge
1303,"Visited on 1st June 2015 before UA 918 to LHR. Even though this lounge was overcrowded ( at 15:30 )and required a considerable odyssey from the UA gates, it was still worth the trek. They have champagne, free cocktails, and a more-than-adequate supply of good things to eat. There are big windows that overlook the tarmac, and you certainly get a good view of an Austrian Airlines 767. In sum, German efficiency, fine hospitality, and easily the best lounge at IAD If you're Star Gold, take the hike.",lounge
1304,Very disappointing. No real food during mid-day. No free wi-fi beyond what the airport provides (one half hour). Not what we would have expected.,lounge
1305,Another visit to this lounge and nothing has been done to improve the miserably inadequate levels of catering. Soup or spaetzle potato salad and that's about it apart from a few pieces of bread and some peppers plus sweets and peanuts. So I've made yet another complaint and will keep doing so until something is done to improve matters.,lounge
1306,The standard of catering in this lounge continues to deteriorate. Today the only choices were broth or soup - and a couple of trays of stewed vegetables. Plus the usual potato salad bread etc - but no meat of any kind. This lounge was once quite good but is now very mediocre. Also WiFi is often stretched to the limit. The two receptionists seemed totally bored and lacked much in the way of customer service skills. Come on Lufthansa - give this place a much-needed make over!,lounge
1307,Fantastic lounge with spacious shower rooms and ample seating. The buffet has a wide variety of food and beverages along with excellent staff.,lounge
1308,Lounge was comfortable but a few more quiet areas would have been nicer: i.e. more space. Good choice of snacks refreshments & warm food. No queues & adequate to drink. Was not aware of any massage services.,lounge
1309,The lounge is hopelessly overcrowded the wifi doesn't function the food quality & display leave a lot to be desired. The cleanliness of the food preparation counters are unappetizing. Lufthansa & the Star Alliance are doing themselves a dis-service in offering its business class passengers this lounge.,lounge
1310,Obviously new. Very comfortable with showers available. 2 beers on tap pour your own. Nice selection of wines. We were there at lunch time and had hot dogs and 2 different soups plus salad bar. Wifi instant connect with no password. Certainly better lounge than a lot.,lounge
1311,The most complicated WiFi-access ever. The Lufthansa/Star Alliance lounge at the Delhi International Airport is fine except for the strange WiFi-routines. The lounge is big nice furniture good access to electricity nice staff clean good food and beverage selection clean restrooms but the WiFi! You receive an access code per device. You have to enter these codes and then wait for an SMS with some kind of verification code. When you return to the webpage after receiving the SMS-sent code then you are back to the initial page again and have to start all over again. If you are lucky you are logged in. If you are inactive on the internet for a few minutes you are logged out and have to ask for a new code and start all over again. Why make it so complicated. It is like the domestic Lufthansa lounges in the early 2000s.,lounge
1312,The new lounge which was opened at the same time as new Z Concourse is very modern. However I noticed that the food selection and quality is getting lower each month. The sweets are just regular cookies but in the past there were chocolate pastries! The LH staff at the counter inside is far more occupied by phone or chit-chatting with each other than taking care of the passengers. I also noticed they grab drinks and snacks from the main bar and would enjoy them at their work position. No more refreshing towels on display to take. Now you have to ask for them at the counter and you get no more than 2!,lounge
1313,"Pleasant and spacious lounge with an acceptably tasty selection of warm/cold food snacks and beverages. Entrance staffing is odd. Non-LH entrance check leaves the two LH lounge dragons free to communicate nonstop. Which they do. Not by way of greeting guests more like ""nonstop them"". Weird choices of hot food: Both dishes were made of pork on both visits highly Muslim-friendly. The longest mobile-phone conversation clearly audible was when a Sky Chefs employee answered her phone to discuss her Sunday lunch. At least it sounded more interesting than what Sky Chefs offered in the lounge. Empty trays used to be refilled at faster speeds so your selection may be drastically reduced during a short visit. Empty dishes are removed from tables at infrequent intervals. Sky Chefs and LH offer a consistent experience: They present themselves as self-serving organisations which will accommodate customers albeit grudgingly and only once done with themselves.",lounge
1314,Very decent size with a good range of food and drink available including weissbier on tap which is always welcome and traditional Bavarian specialties; welcoming area and a good amount of seating. Excellent selection of newspapers and a nice place to spend some time before the flight. No announcements; you need to check the screens yourself. Worth visiting again.,lounge
1315,The lounge was very busy at peak times however the food was good and the bathrooms were clean.,lounge
1316,An excellent lounge - bright comfortable welcoming staff good food and drinks. There was a calm environment friendly and efficient. Food was good in quality and variety and the drinks were plentiful and restocked efficiently. Very good.,lounge
1317,Fairly simple in all respects but calm and not too busy. Easy to get things done so functionally good. Service is ok but lacks warmth something I have noticed in the lounge on Level G too.,lounge
1318,First time in this lounge used AA Admirals Club and TAM First Class lounges previously while traveling on Lufthansa. This lounge is a downgrade. Very small and claustrophobic with no views and no windows. A small buffet of sub-standard appetizers including small salads and sweets which did not look appetizing. A poor bar selection couldn't find anything I wanted to drink. Had to seat and wait but temperature in the room was really high and I decided to leave and wait close to the gate instead. Hope Lufthansa will find a better options for their First and Business class customers as this does not match their high standards.,lounge
1319,Munich First Class lounge is still one of Lufthansa's best. Very well appointed elegant and classy with great service. In the restaurant plenty of good choices both on buffet and a la carte menu. Extensive wines and spirit list. Large magazines and newspapers selection. In the spa I noticed a drop in the level of service they no longer provided bath salts and other toiletries but one generic shower gel to be used as bubble bath shampoo soap and everything else. Even the now famous Lufthansa rubber duck was not available at first and had to be requested. Wifi was not working and receptionist suggested me to use the general Munich Flufghafen wifi which was ok. Later on board their wifi was out too. At the time of boarding had to walk for more than 10 minutes to the gate while in Frankfurt they automatically offer to take you to plane by a limo. They need to maintain the same standard as in their Frankfurt lounges.,lounge
1320,A very nice lounge great cocktail bar. Food was also good and a fair choice. Staff friendly. Close to the smoking room. Good size with lots of areas to relax in.,lounge
1321,Staff is excellent very attentive and friendly. Kids enjoyed the special kids play area. We spent some time in the shower section. Identical with all FCL of LH but here just only one has jacuzzi. Enzo toiletries and have time to relax and refresh. Breakfast choice was ok but quality of some items (croissant pastries) could be better for this level of lounge. Drink choice was really huge and fine. Food that starts at 10.30 is outstanding. Several dishes on buffet but the real top is the a la carte restaurant. Finally via private car (a Merc mini van as we were 4 ) to the aircraft. In total really 5 star experience.,lounge
1322,The lounge was busy and quite small and it is as with Terminal 1 ageing. There was still a very poor choice of food and beverages- only a poor quality English breakfast cereals and various hot and cold drinks were available. The lounge was quite comfortable with clean washrooms and good Wifi that worked well but the tables were quite dirty making for an average experience.,lounge
1323,This is nice new lounge with ok food offerings good selection of beverages and newspapers/magazines. The free WIFI is not fast but works ok for e-mails. The main issue is that it is too small or that too many are allowed into it. In any case it is very difficult to find a place here the toilets are also overcrowded. For some reason they also decided to put just one person in front of the lounge to check your boarding pass so this takes a while especially with people using this employee as an information point. All-in-all good if you manage to find a spot. A definite improvement to the old lounges however.,lounge
1324,Newly opened lounge features impressive seating place with a brilliant view of an apron. There is free wi-fi inside with a very high operating speed. Nice generous choice of food (sandwiches crisps snacks etc.) and one of the best bargains of the alcohol-drinks I've ever seen!,lounge
1325,Lufthansa (LH) runs this Lounge as part of the SAS business lounge. The location is not that bad as the backdoor brings you directly to the gate and the staff calls for your flight. It's rather small with about 25 seats. Free Magazines and Papers WiFi 4 computers. Beverages are to LH standards food however is below standard. Waiting here for about 90min no problem 5 hrs would be a nightmare.,lounge
1326,Spacious lounge just beyond security in terminal A. Leather armchairs plenty of power points and some nice food although the range is a bit limited. Pleasant place to wait for a flight especially as there's not much at all in the airport itself!,lounge
1327,This lounge is very nice with a view on the tarmac reading material good selection of cold dishes desserts and drinks. I have not figured out whether there is free wifi. A good product from Luxair and enjoyable before a flight.,lounge
1328,Arrived with Austrian Airlines at T1 and had a connecting flight to Sao Paulo with Lufthansa. I had to leave the main terminal and after a 6-8 minutes outside walk entered the First Class Terminal. Receptionist helped me with passport and security control and showed me the facilities which are exclusive for long haul First class passengers. The terminal has its own duty free and lounge with different seating areas huge bar restaurant and buffet area cigar room bathrooms etc. It is big and very elegant with many leather chairs and sofas and smaller rooms. It has large windows but no apron or runaways views. Huge bathroom complete with plushy towels and bathrobe and ETRO toiletries. Jacuzzi had none of the special spa features of the similar one at their Munich lounge. Small Duty Free had the main brands. Extensive menu for dinner buffet and a-la-carte restaurant but chose to have dinner on the flight instead. Great selection of magazines but wanted to use a computer and was told they no longer offer computers in the lounge which was a disappointment. 30 minutes before departure escorted downstairs where my passport was checked and Porsche Cayenne to the aircraft. This is a huge terminal which never got crowded very comfortable luxurious and well-appointed. It lacks some of the details of their smaller lounge in Munich.,lounge
1329,This lounge doubles as an arrivals and departures lounge so after a flight from Sao Paulo I decided to use the lounge. Nice reception with welcoming staff handed my passport to an official so passport control done in the lounge area which was and nice. Beautiful lounge not a huge one but cozy with different seating areas to choose with leather sofas and cocktail tables (with Mozart chocolates). 4 or 5 computer stations. Decided to take a bath more than half-a dozen bathrooms. Large marbled room with a jacuzzi rain shower area with bathrobe towels slippers and ETRO amenities. Staff came back with the Lufthansa First Class Lounge Rubber Duck! In the restaurant area I was handed a menu with brunch choices cooked according to taste but decided to check the buffet instead. Several choices of breads cheeses meats smoked fishes 2 or 3 hot entrees sweets etc. Unfortunately the lounge is inside the terminal and offers no apron or runway view but it does provide friendly and efficient service.,lounge
1330,This is a delightful lounge. The staff knew who we were as I had asked for a massage to be pre- arranged. Check in was efficient. The first visit was on the outward flight to Cape town - so a long bath and rest before dining as we had plenty of time. The service was very friendly. On the return journey we arrived at 0500 and had 3 hours in the lounge. This time it was more crowded but the service again was impeccable - had a shower and a lovely breakfast. The best bit was the fact the plane was not on a stand so we were taken to the plane by a Merc.,lounge
1331,Concourse B luggage pick up area outstanding welcome lounge. Excellent breakfast shower area very clean bathrooms. A very good Lufthansa product.,lounge
1332,Excellent lounge if you come in early. Food selection mainly sandwiches. Beverage all type of sodas beer wine coffee. The boarding is outstanding as you don't have to be staying in line with the crowd.,lounge
1333,Travelling with Lufthansa between MIA-FRA. The worst lounge I have ever visited. No service. Food - I would not even call that refreshments awful quality. Drinks only from the bar from a bartender - nothing special. Wi-Fi really slow practically impossible to use. Very crowded. No newspapers. Not worth it. No other options on Concourse J. Very poor facility comparing to regular Lufthansa or other Star Alliance lounges.,lounge
1334,The lounge in the B concourse area looks very similar to the First Class Terminal but they are worlds apart. This morning there were two men and a woman to greet guests as they arrived. The two men were completely disinterested in greeting or lending a hand to adjust our seats on the next flight. It was like pulling teeth to have them assign us two seats together even though we already knew the flight was nearly half empty. They really don't belong especially after having just stepped off a terrific flight where every staff member did their absolute best to ensure a restful and pleasant journey for each passenger. The lounge is quite full almost every seat is taken. The food offerings look decent but perhaps a tad tired as it's nearly time to switch out for the lunch menu.,lounge
1335,They offer only a small snack. I have been in the Lufthansa lounge B48 on my last flight. That lounge offers much more food and facilities. I was very angry what they offer the passenger at this C16 lounge.,lounge
1336,This is a new lounge and much better than the previous shared lounges. Quiet Wifi reasonable food offerings. Very attentive staff.,lounge
1337,I am not sure why I still go to this lounge as it has always been overcrowded not particularly clean with poor food offerings. This time the airport public areas outside were more peaceful than this place. Lufthansa really needs to take a look at this lounge and improve the standards as it is an embarrassment.,lounge
1338,This Senator lounge in Munich is one of my favourite. Cosy friendly staff amazing food high quality of wine and champagne and nice atmosphere. This lounge is only for Senator customers and Star Alliance Gold card holders.,lounge
1339,Totally disappointing! Lufthansa advertises its Lounges as something exclusive. But the Lufthansa Business Lounge is such a shame. Food offer is bread rolls jam butter yoghurt a banana and pickled cucumbers. In Berlin at least it was empty but Munich was crowded in a way you don't even find a seat. Having in mind that in order to get into these lounges you were first paying Thousands of euro to Lufthansa flight tickets I am seriously surprised.,lounge
1340,Very large lounge it seemed crowded at first but as we walked in a clockwise circle the crowd thinned. A huge variety of snacks and treats to enjoy. A few English newspapers no magazines except Golf. The bathrooms were cramped and awkward to use but clean. The wifi was free. It was a nice place to hang out for 2 hrs between flights.,lounge
1341,They know you and where you travel to when you enter the lounge immigration happens there and personally. The lounge is modern but with a warm atmosphere. You can help yourself at the buffet drinks are served to your seat or you can order a hot meal cooked freshly. The selection of food and drinks is great. Huge showers and you can have a bath if you like. Best of all you'll be taken to the plane by limousine if it's parked on an outside position and not docked to a gate.,lounge
1342,What a wonderful enclave of service tucked into DTW's new North terminal. Excellent food/champagne. Attentive staff. Quiet/refined service. Beats any other business lounge in the USA. Limited hours but when open cannot be topped!,lounge
1343,Lounge is small but nice the only option for Star travellers in Mumbai. Staff welcoming and smiley. Food limited but more than just snacks. Could do with computer terminals in case you don't have a wifi device with you. Two let downs are it not having a flight screen at all in the lounge. Also they had a row of clocks for world time and had taken the Mumbai one down - I couldn't work out why if that one broke they didn't put the Singapore clock in its place and change its time.,lounge
1344,An older and smaller lounge of other Lufthansa lounges at Frankfurt. It is packed at all times and even if service is constant (bar and food) it is impossible to relax and have a seat. The venue is not at all in accordance with today's traveller. Staff should avoid having drinks and snacks from the passenger area and consumed at the front desk.,lounge
1345,The Star Alliance lounge at CDG in terminal 2 near gates 60-6 is downstairs. The space proved to be comfortable and quiet with a very good selection of snacks drinks and sandwiches.,lounge
1346,It was a not up to par with Emirates/Qatar lounges it is very hard to find. The personal assistants are not all equal ours was not very good. You can not get a VAT refund for merchandise purchased that is considered carry-on. Beware of this fact. Breakfast area seemed busy and employees falling behind in servicing passengers. Quiet areas (non- cellphone areas) are not enforced and there was always someone talking everywhere even near the quiet relaxing chairs with blankets. Limo service to your flight you better request or demand the car you want when you arrive. They put my wife and I in a Minivan with two strangers Business class HON members. I felt this Terminal relative to my experiences around the world with others such as Qatar SIA etc was very poor. There are many Business class lounges that are better than Lufthansa's First Class Terminal experience.,lounge
1347,Good lounge with great views. Selection of simple sandwiches and variety of drinks including alcoholic beverages. This lounge can get really crowded though with people lining up in front of the elevators.,lounge
1348,"Small Lounge no bathrooms no showers no baggage storage. Every drink has to be ordered at the bar you have to wait for the staff to show up. After several minutes of waiting for the Barkeeper I finally ordered 2 Cokes for me and my friend. When she asked me if I'd want anything else I asked for 2 additional Cokes as we were very thirsty and didn't know if she was going to leave again. Her answer: ""you can have one and have to come back to get another one"". Avoid that uncomfortable place with rude staff!",lounge
1349,I splurged on business class tickets to take my 92 yr old mother to Russia. A reason for going business class was to have a comfortable place to wait during layovers in Frankfurt. What a mistake! The business class lounges were so crowded people were waiting in line to get in. Inside there was a cattle car feeling with no place to sit and no fresh air. I was mortified that my mother was forced to sit out in the airport lobby after I had promised her the luxury of business class. Never again Lufthansa!,lounge
1350,Compared to some time ago the lounges have improved . Instead of haribo sweets and beer they now offer simple sandwiches hot food desserts variety of cold dishes as well as a good choice in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Staff friendly and good storage space. I think the main problems however are that a lot of people can make use of the lounges and they are overcrowded. Also a limited budget for the food and beverage service is evident. The lounge offered seating free wifi a drink and a nibble and storage for luggage.,lounge
1351,Mediocrity is the word that comes to mind. In terms of food the quality is subpar - it is horrible if you are a vegetarian. Quality of drinks is also below average. The seats are not comfortable and there is an air of tightness and inability to move around effortlessly. To me two positives stood out - the shower was wonderful (some toiletries provided) and the storage area to lock your handbags so you don't have to take them around. This is not a nice lounge.,lounge
1352,Stopped by the gate A26 Senator Lounge at around 8am on a layover to Graz Austria. Terribly overcrowded. I took one walk around found no seats available took note of the 20 people standing around waiting for a seat and immediately left. I'm sure the food and beverages were fine but if I can't sit down what's the point. So the only thing I can rate this lounge on is comfort which gets a very poor score.,lounge
1353,"Visited this Senator lounge located at Gate B43 arriving at around noon. After visiting the Senator lounge at Gate A26 a week previously I was expecting the worst (cramped no seats available should be used as a broom closet etc). When I entered the lounge I was pleasantly surprised. This lounge is huge and was filled only to about 20% capacity. Very spacious and clean you aren't cramped. Although the lounge did fill up while I was there seats were available. The breakfast food was fine and plentiful and beverage selection is what you'd expect in a lounge. The staff were pleasant; they greeted as you arrived and farewell as you left. There was a bartender on hand to mix drinks. I had excellent WiFi connectivity. I just wished that there was a fine lounge like this at the ""A"" departure gates so that I can relax at my layover when I'm entering Europe instead of just when I'm leaving it.",lounge
1354,This is the main hub of Lufthansa surely the most frequently used Senator Lounge in their entire network and yet it's tiny totally cramped and has absolutely no imagination style or flare in their decor at all. It looks like a cafeteria in an office building in 1990s Germany. When i arrived there were no seats at all available and I was forced to stand around waiting for 5 mins before I could even sit down. And the food was just very German (Bavarian) meat dishes with a cold creamy potato salad being the only vegetarian option in the whole place. Only 1 tv screen in one corner with no sound and I cant believe in another corner is a LCD display only showing tv advertising!! Having just come from the fantastic modern beautifully designed Senator lounge at JFK this feels like an economy lounge for Easyjet.,lounge
1355,Beautiful Lounge well designed modern and well catered by polite and efficient staff. Food quality was excellent. Probably one of the best lounges I've been in for ages.,lounge
1356,Our flight from JFK landed half an hour early and there were many of us waiting outside for a considerable amount of time before the staff begrudgingly opened the lounge. One wonders if they knew we were coming! Showers are gorgeous food is acceptable but lounge staff attitude appalling. Such a contrast to other airline arrival lounges where they cannot do enough to help.,lounge
1357,"Malaysia Airlines use the Air France Salon Première lounge at Charles De Gaulle Airport, Terminal 1. The lounge itself is nothing special with very limited selection of food and drinks and no toilets (have to go outside), but coffee and croissants/pain au Chocolat for breakfast are pretty decent. What's more important is that when you are travelling on a MAS flight as oneworld Sapphire Card holder MAS tries to send you to the dreadful ICare lounge. I was there for one minute and felt like cattle in a market. Literally no seats available and an extremely small space to manoeuvre. But oneworld Sapphire can also enter La Première and that would give you at least a more humane experience.",lounge
1358,I have been so appalled by the dismal Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at the A-Gates in Frankfurt that I felt the need to write a review. First and foremost the room was so hopelessly overcrowded there was barely a single free seat! Food offering is not just bad it is simply non-existent (if you like me don't consider peanuts a muffin and a slice of bread as a food offering). The overcrowding coupled with the sadly decreasing levels of etiquette and many people talking loudly on cell phones leads to simply unbearable noise levels. Slow wireless internet is available and is free but I can't imagine that anyone could get any serious work done in this type of environment. Highly unpleasant a disgrace.,lounge
1359,Been to 2 different business class lounges Mumbai and Munich. To be honest there is nothing much to offer. The lounges are overcrowded and the food is nothing great. To add internet access at Munich is not free! Also no reclining seats so no comfort to the back or neck at transit airports like Munich.,lounge
1360,Incredible service very attentive friendly and professional! Overall a most pleasant experience and a huge difference to most other airport lounges.,lounge
1361,"Oh what a difference a few years makes. On visiting this lounge in 2012 I thought it was one of the best I had been through, not this time. Tired, lights not working, food selection nothing like it used to be. Limited selection of drinks. Messy and unclean. Rest rooms that were filthy, no hand dryer that worked, and no paper towels. Lots of staff doing very little - well doing nothing. Lots of seating and that is one of the few positives, other than decent wi-fi. I have been a champion for Malaysia Airlines for a number of years, and I can see there is a whole world of challenges for the new CEO. This time around I cannot recommend using the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge in the International Satellite Building. I've used the Priority ""paid"" lounge and that was 100 times better than the Golden Wing Lounge, which is sad to say.",lounge
1362,Thought this lounge was below par because there are no dedicated bathroom facilities. The guest relations person was very helpful but it is not all about that is it!,lounge
1363,What a shocker! Confusing and overall a general lack of customer service. From the disinterested staff on the reception desk to the very poor washroom facilities. Food choices limited and overall a disappointing experience!,lounge
1364,"Awful place. Not recommended. Dirty. Complimentary wifi requires red club membership. Very basic snacks. Not even close to the very basic business class standards. Try to avoid. Too pitiful Lufthansa partners with the guys to offer their ""business"" lounge to its passengers.",lounge
1365,I must confirm that the Lufthansa Business class lounges (visited 3 at Frankfurt and one in Johannesburg ) are the worst without any doubt of any airline. If you are hungry visit a restaurant at the airport as the best Lufthansa has to offer is a huge bread roll with two coin sized slices of polony/fake ham. Queued for a toilet. Waited 30 min for a shower.,lounge
1366,One word terrible. Munich lounge Friday evening over crowded shabby and a disgrace to an alleged 4 star airline. One to be avoided at all costs.,lounge
1367,I recently travelled with Malaysia Airlines to and from Paris and so had the misfortune of using the iCare (OneWorld) Business lounge in CDG terminal 1. What a dump! Very small with old worn out couches. No Television or newspapers disgusting food and coffee no departure information screen and staff who are friendly but unable to know how to mix a simple drink. There are also no showers or change rooms and the toilets are outside of the lounge and shared by all of the business lounges. Definitely one of the worst Oneworld lounges I have used anywhere. But it does match with the rest of CDG airport which is also poorly designed badly maintained and very user unfriendly.,lounge
1368,"Very ordinary particularly if you like a glass of wine and internet that is better than dial up. The general feel is ok until you get down to detail. First the bar which is not self serve and even beer is neither on display or available for self selection. As for red wine "" we only have merlot"" of a very ordinary kind. There is a first class lounge apparently at the ""satellite"" wherever that is but you won't be told about it in the main terminal unless you ask even if you are eligible. There is a definite don't care attitude in this place and as others have commented the showers and toilets are usable but not great. The food is ok and you can get freshly cooked noodles but it is pretty tasteless. Nothing here to encourage me to use MH or KL as a preferred hub but I guess I am spoilt with my regular regional being SQ with its very superior Singapore hub.",lounge
1369,In most respects this lounge is adequate. The WiFi is outrageously bad. On 1st April I got 7 Kbps download. Impossible to download even one email. Two other nearby pax complained. I went to reception where the agent said she gets so many complaints management doesn't act and please fill out a complaint form. MH management - are you listening? Go down the street and buy a decent router. Subscribe to a decent broadband service. Stop mucking around and deliver - most of us in this lounge are on business and internet is vital.,lounge
1370,Terminal A : Had to go there since the only business lounge available was this. Very crowded couldn't find a single seat! I could swear that some were leaning on sofa chairs for rest till somebody leaves a spot. Not a single item of food was visible only draft beer. We had to leave since no seat was available and it was better to get some food outside. I wouldn't dream of coming here again. Terminal B a lot more spacious than the one in A. More food selection (bread vegetable noodle soup cream cheese/Butter olives and pickles) and soft drinks/beer is provided. A single 40inch-something monitor was only available. Good selection of newspapers (they had chinese/arabic newspapers as well I was surprised). An okay lounge but it would need more improvement on the food bar selection. Both lounges you have to pay for Wi-Fi.,lounge
1371,Lounge was over crowded and there was no where for me to sit. Wifi was not free which is joke and of the computers that offered 'Free Wifi' I was unable to log into any of my email accounts - the internet just didn't work. Onboard I was promised 'free breakfast at the business class lounge' on arrival at the airport should I choose not to eat on the plane. Imagine my disappointment when all that was available was asparagus soup - that tasted like dish water. Coming off an overnight flight from the US and waiting to connect to another flight I expected better food to be waiting for me and at least a place to sit and be able to check my emails also.,lounge
1372,Spent half-an-hour in this lounge yesterday and I thought that it was very much in line with the typical Lufthansa offering. Even food and snacks feel standardized across the world when you travel Lufthansa! I liked the good location close to the gates and pleasant staff. I disliked the bulky and complicated way to get Internet Access and the computers in the lounge should have been sent to a museum about ten years ago!,lounge
1373,There have clearly been some attempts to upgrade this place since I was last there 3 years ago but without too much success  it has to be said. Another of those huge impersonal lounges that can get crowded. Without wishing to be snobbish this seems to be as a result of allowing access to non Biz/First class passengers who are on other airlines' FF lists or have just bought passes for cash. I suppose the rather bizarre almost 'speakeasy' hidden alcohol bar is a sop to the religious people in the country and the choice/quality is OK but no more. Also food is adequate without being impressive. Seating is reasonably comfortable but the toilets/showers are starting to show their age. To be quite honest the MAS Business class lounge in the domestic part of the terminal is a far nicer experience less impersonal better seating and food (including an absolutely fantastic malay chicken curry). OK they do not pretend to serve alcohol (as on their domestic flights) but at least you know where you stand.,lounge
1374,A surprisingly poor offering from MAS. This lounge is large poorly arranged (seats in lines and very closely spaced) dirty poorly equipped and in dire need of renovation. There is a small bar near the entrance which serves a very limited selection of alcoholic drinks (no self service) including a couple of poor quality wines beer and no champagne or spirits. The bar also closes early regardless of the number of passengers in the lounge. Hot food was cold and there was a very limited selection. Hot drinks machines were poor but there was a serviced coffee bar with a good selection of coffees and teas made to order. WiFi so slow it was next to useless. Overall very poor - looking forward to the Emirates Lounge reopening after refurbishment.,lounge
1375,There is a Golden Lounge located in both terminals. This I found out after being directed to the satellite terminal by airport staff when I could have stayed in the main terminal. I preferred the main terminal lounge. The food was of good quality with hot and cold options. I arrived just before the change over from breakfast to lunch. There is a bar but you are made to feel awkward as it's hidden away. The tables are not cleared very often however and there was only a cold shower available.,lounge
1376,"Overcrowded at first but it cleared out as I had four hours to wait on my flight. This is the only lounge I have seen within the Star Alliance group to charge for internet usage. That is just stupid. As always the staff are unpleasant and unhelpful. When I asked if I could get a wireless card with a password I was told and I quote: ""Yes. Your Credit Card."" very succinctly. I have to agree with most of the reviews I have seen so far - chairs are uncomfortable it can be very crowded and the two tiny elevators allowing access to the lounge are ridiculous and slow. All of the Star Alliance airlines need to get together and take a course from Singapore Airlines on how to run a proper lounge. Services are so inconsistent across all of the airlines that it's almost comedic.",lounge
1377,Overcrowded mess. The worst thing is that the only way to get in or out (barring a fire) is through two tiny and slow elevators. I was shocked when I was trying to go to my plane and I had to wait for a long line to clear just to get out. I'm sure people have missed their flights because of that set up.,lounge
1378,"As I write I am sitting in this lounge. Of course I cannot use my own computer unless I pay 8 euros per hour : 9 booths are provided free so one waits for one of these to be unoccupied. The business class lounge is better than this one a better selection of food and drinks and some (not all) of the staff make an effort to please. Here for lunch there is a selection of nibbles and one dish. There are 6 wines on offer 2 of which are inferior ""Methode"" sparkling whites: the best is a medium grade red rioja. The showers are fine provided you use them late afternoon. If you wait until just before a late flight as is normal they are crowded. When I think of the facilities offered in Changi I have to ask myself why SIA want to be in this alliance.",lounge
1379,Difficult when airlines use a generic airport lounge for a small number of business class passengers. The lounge is new but the food on offer wasn't appealing.,lounge
1380,UseHaving used this lounge for the past 6 years to travel from KL to Beijing the time has come to switch to Singapore Airlines although more costly and a longer flight. The toilets today (10 Mar 15) were disgusting and unusable and clearly hadn't been cleaned for a while and the service in their so called sports bar was beyond comprehension. Clearly the airline is going through difficult times but surely now if the the time to do whatever is possible to increase the customers experience. I complained to two people in the lounge who really couldn't care and never made any attempt to apologize or have the toilets cleaned so enough is enough.,lounge
1381,UseMy flight was 3 hours ahead and I spent my quality time waiting in this lounge. The environment was quiet and cozy. The food was absolutely delicious especially the beef rendang! I kept on refilling my plates while waiting. There's even a massage corner. However the WiFi was just average. But nevertheless I would definitely come again here! A very welcoming lounge.,lounge
1382,The lounge feels like a mess hall rather than a lounge. Wifi is not free the furniture is not comfortable and the place is overcrowded. As I type this I am sharing a small table with three other people who were scrambling for a seat. This place is comparable to an overcrowded bus in Cairo.,lounge
1383,Was on route to DUB via MUC had the chance to sample the Lufthansa lounge in IST. The best thing about this place is knowing you will be leaving. Dark and dirty are the two words that best capture the feel of this place. No external windows carpets and soft furnishings were well past their sell by date. The snacks and beverages were very average. Find it hard to think that Lufthansa would be happy to use this lounge going forward. The positive was that there was free Wi Fi.,lounge
1384,The decor is a bit cold and not very welcoming. The selection of food limited though the Oktober Fest special was a nice touch. The selection of drinks is varied and good. I find it really strange that Lufthansa does not offer free WiFi in their Senator lounges (nor the business class lounges). But the lounge is a welcome escape from the not very customer friendly Tegel airport. The staff at the front desk not very welcoming though I have had very good experiences at other times.,lounge
1385,Even though it was a small lounge it was very cosy. There are good views of the tarmac as well. The staff were very polite. The whole lounge was very clean including the toilets. Maybe if there was one small thing I would pick on is to have more varieties of food. Other than that the lounge is wonderful and I would recommend it.,lounge
1386,Used this lounge on the outward and inward trips LHR/Sydney. Spacious comfortable friendly staff. Shower facilities very adequate and clean. Quite a good choice of food and drinks - no problem with having a designated area for serving alcohol.,lounge
1387,The lounge entrance is impressive & the reception staff welcoming once inside the lounge the furnishings looked cheap food selection was good. The wine selection terrible on offer was a cheap white red passable & champagne was good. This lounge is in need of an upgrade.,lounge
1388,At the time we were there the lounge was quiet and peaceful. There is table seating near the food. The food selection was not extraordinary but okay. There is a nice selection of beverages hot and cold. Nice comfortable lounge chairs.,lounge
1389,A bit disappointing. Stale bread watery fruit salad some nuts and a full freezer full of mini-ice creams - an odd mix of food! Wifi and computers were spotty but they did try to fix them immediately. Lounge was fairly comfortable if a bit drab and boring. Was starving but had to go outside to the airport where there were many good options to purchase food.,lounge
1390,Shared lounge with SAS and has a very minimalist Scandinavian appeal. Nice variety of breads cold cuts cheeses fruit drinks (wine beer alcohol and soft drinks) etc. A few computer terminals magazines and fresh fruit scattered around.,lounge
1391,Spacious good views of lanes outside. Sleeping massage and shower facilities. Lounge is kept in dull brown colours. Good food inc. 3 options of hot dishes from Malay kitchen. Alcohol separated from lounge and referred to the entrance at a small side-room. Only Carlsberg beer 2-3 wines and 1 champagne available.,lounge
1392,We use this lounge twice a year on return flights to Europe. It does the job. However dispte some renovation recently it could do with better and more shower cubicles and also toilets. Quite often there is a wait for both. Food and drinks adequate. They do need to lift the lounge to bring it up to the standards expected. They operate a very good business class in their planes. They may have to spend some money to bring the lounge up to the standard of their aircraft.,lounge
1393,This lounge is an embarrassment. Staff is largely absent food is Lukewarm lounge is an open seating area in the mezzanine of Delhi International where the noise comes in unfiltered there are four old Win95 desktops WiFi requires a complex picture ID procedure and bathrooms are basically the same quality toilets you find anywhere in the airport (so forget freshening up). There is some premium Lounge next door but the difference in access to the two is unclear to me. At any rate lounges like this make me wonder whether I should fly this airline at all again. Hopefully their hub lounge in KL is better.,lounge
1394,Very welcoming and polite staff nice catering big choice for hot and cold drinks. Alcohol included. Nice and comfortable relax space the lounge is big. There is also smoking room separate.,lounge
1395,Being quite spacious the lounge features several areas. A working area for laptop users a kind of bistro area and a spacious relaxation area with several TV screens. Two lavatories and two bars (with only one featuring the full variety of available snacks and drinks). Snacks include the usual cake and soup selections drinks include soft and hard beverages alongside two kinds of draught beer. Wireless internet is not available free of charge.,lounge
1396,The lounge was a joke! We flew a Star Alliance airline and was told that we could use Lufthansa business lounge. We had to walk very far from our gate go through a security check point to get to the lounge. Then later after we exited from the lounge we had to go through another security check point at our gate. That added up to a lot of time. We hope for a decent cup of coffee but it was terrible coming out of a coffee machine. A few cups of yogurt on a tray open to all sneezing customers. Sandwiches were made with old bread as hard as rock! No free internet connection! We will not go to this lounge again and will complain to our airline.,lounge
1397,The standard and variety of food and beverages available in this Gold Card-only lounge continue to deteriorate. The furniture isn't particularly comfortable working space is cramped and the whole ambience of the place is very run down and second rate. Presumably it's because Lufthansa spend all their resources pandering to the first class lounge users and do not see their Gold Card holders as meriting much in the way of service. It used to be a lot better; why have they allowed their standards to slip so low?,lounge
1398,MAS continues to do what it does well - disappoint. How hard can it be to keep a place clean have staff who want to help food that is worth eating and provide alcohol without guests feeling like they should not drink alcohol. Seems all of this is impossible for MH. Perhaps one needs to have to have a different mindset to truly appreciate Malaysian Hospitality?,lounge
1399,Used the lounge while waiting for flight to Auckland. Spacious yes - impressed no. At the front desk beyond asking for the boarding pass frontline staff seem to assume that everyone who came knew what the Golden Lounge had to offer. No attempt to explain its facilities. Upon entering you come upon the room where liquor is served but it was small and so far from everything else. Sofa seats were arranged in lines and close together. Buffet choices very limited. Everything was self service much like a canteen. Glasses so small probably to discourage one from taking too much thus necessitating frequent trips for refills. I stood there for 3 glasses of juice before I moved off with a 4th. That's how small the glasses were. Tables while cleared of glasses and plates were not wiped down. I saw just one staff clearing tables. I did not realise there was 2 other counters serving food. There was no signboard to the shower/washrooms. Inside the shower stalls were not clean bits of hair left behind and why is the floor in the shower area level with the changing area. Good thing my shoes were near the outer door or they would have been soaked. After what you read in the Malaysia Airlines web page this was a disappointment you've oversold yourself. Come on MAS you can do better than this.,lounge
1400,Suffice to say it was quite ordinary. All cold not covered food. Seats were comfortable is the best I can say.,lounge
1401,The lounge is small and due to Lufthansa expansion in Milan it turns very overcrowded. About 5pm no place to seat at all. Only 2 PC's available in the whole lounge. Some cold snacks (good Italian cheese some sandwiches fruit salad) standard selection of drinks. No toilets inside.,lounge
1402,Super lounge continues to uphold their high standards. Great food and beverage options decent WiFi excellent showers and best of all superb service. The professional staff treats all passengers with grace and efficient charm. The private security area is a breeze and the limo ride to the plane is always a treat whereas the van ride falls short of first class expectations.,lounge
1403,Hon circle lounge at Frankfurt is very spacious and tastefully appointed lounge. Sit down restaurant area with excellent food options full bar with bar tender. Separate cigar / smoking room. Well appointed showers and SPA in the lounge. To board the flight you take a elevator to the ground level quick security check and Lufthansa drives you directly to the gate.,lounge
1404,Was looking to experience this so called MH flagship lounge. But I only found great disappointments once I arrived there. The newly renovated lounge had a cheap mess hall or school canteen feel to it as the chairs and tables were plonked in lines and rows in a big open area (not to mention the bland high ceiling) to maximize the capacity. As a result no 'personal space' and very crowded as everybody was close to each other. Chairs not comfy. No sign to the toilets had to ask staff for it. The toilet was so basic and small. Food selection adequate but not extensive. It's understandable due to their religion practice they set up the bar way off the main dining area and very close to the main entrance and had a walk a fair bit to get a glass of drinks. Internet was fast and reliable. Overall I was not impressed with this 5-star lounge.,lounge
1405,Upgrading lounge so 'temporary' lounge is in a grotty couple of rooms next to Starbucks. Check In staff didn't even mention that the real lounge was closed. Almost no airport staff knew where the lounge was and the only sign is a hand written a4 sheet taped to the door. Catering was awful alcohol none existent and staff very stand offish.,lounge
1406,After a flight into KLIA from PER I was looking forward to using their flagship lounge to freshen up and relax before continuing onto LHR late that evening. What a let down. Trying to find a seat was the first obstacle my wife and I encountered and when we finally did trying to locate staff to clean the area was our next. Requesting use of the showers was met with a courteous and immediate response of yes. However when I entered through the doors it was like the area had not been serviced since the first flight of the day. No toilet tissue to be found unless you raided every cubicle prior. And the floors needed a hose down. Showers only saving grace was that the water pressure and temperature was very good as they were not very clean to begin with. With half an hour before boarding MH2 to LHR I decided to have a drink at the bar by the entrance to lounge. Selections are only average at best with no champagne only a French sparkling but that was no bother as I knew the best was to come on board. To wrap up the experience of what is meant to be their flagship lounge I have noticed its gradual decline since I first started using this service on numerous occasions since 2000. I will be returning from LHR mid Jan and look forward to experiencing the Golden Lounge of Terminal 4 as I have heard great reviews of this one. Will keep you all posted.,lounge
1407,"The intercom button is still a challenge to find at the ground level entrance. Food selection was very good; the alcohol choices were more than extensive. Staff with a few exceptions was very helpful. The cigar lounge (smoking area) for some unknown reason is much larger than the computer area. There were often people waiting to use the handful of computers but no one waiting to use the smoking lounge; at times the WiFi wasn't working adding to the computer delays. Because of the personal/financial security issues with wireless connections I would have expected the first class terminal to use wired connections in the computer cubicles with WiFi (with WPA2 for wireless security) in the rest of the building. Separate cubicles for people with their own laptops are needed so they do not tie up the very limited number of computer/desk cubicles. The fact that the computer cubicles are several steps higher than the main floor level is a design flaw being a hassle for passengers with mobility issues heavy luggage etc. Transport to the plane is a great feature in such a large airport although their policy of waiting until the last minute for this service depends on no slip ups and carries ""just in time"" behavior to far. My driver was about to get my luggage from the trunk of his car when I questioned the model of Airbus we had just parked under ( he had taken me to the wrong gate). If major European airports would use the same gate numbers inside the terminals as outside the terminals it would remove this needless complexity. As I wanted to avoid I had to rush to get settled at my seat before the plane started moving away from the gate.",lounge
1408,This lounge is new in terminal 1C and looks like a canteen. No style at all. Drink choice average food almost non existing. Only nice touch is that it has a direct boarding gate for business passengers. Lounge staff just sit at the door checking if you are qualified to enter. No free wi-fi and this is what I don't understand. It is 2010 now and internet is a part of our and still you have to pay 8 euros for an hour. Lufthansa should be really reconsider the passengers need. The lounge is just gate with some bigger chairs a table with drinks and so called food.,lounge
1409,The lounge was totally crowded with many people standing and not having a seat. Passengers with luggage were bumping into seated travellers while trying to find a space to sit down. Small tables and uncomfy seats. Mediocre food just some awesome sandwiches. As the Star Alliance grows someone would expect an adjusted lounge to cater for the increased number of business and first class traveller. Staff tried hard to clean tables but had a hard time to get glasses and plates back to the kitchen.,lounge
1410,"The business class lounge upstairs in the satellite terminal (that I have visited earlier this year) was closed. The temporary lounge was difficult to find and small with no shower facilities and unwelcoming unhelpful staff. The lounge was cramped and there were no shower facilities and limited food options. So I asked the staff if there was another business class lounge was given confusing instructions by a disinterested & slightly rude staff member and told to go back on the train to the main terminal to the ""regional"" business class lounge (for international and domestic flights). The regional lounge was completely full. Nonetheless after a wait I was able to take a shower in the short time left before my flight. The washroom staff were disinterested and no towels were provided (I used paper towels to dry myself). After having spent my time locating the various lounges there was no time for food and I had to take the train back to the satellite terminal for my flig ht. Once at the gate there was no announcement for business class boarding so I ended up boarding with the rest of the flight. Never again - unacceptable for business class.",lounge
1411,I used the KLIA lounge in transit and was impressed. If in transit stay in the Satellite building and head upstairs when you reach the air train - it isn't incredibly well signposted. It is large with plenty of natural light via big windows it has lockers newspapers magazines and many seating areas. There was a business centre with helpful staff. Lounge PCs offer internet and printing. Excellent range of food included noodles and soups barista made coffees and full range of teas fresh fruit plus I saw a variety of other dishes. There are several food service areas - all have different offerings. There is a bar with limited choices but white wine they offered was fine. Bathrooms with amenity packs and had hot showers both times - they are at the far end of the lounge and staff will give you towels and packs with shampoo etc.,lounge
1412,On our way to Bali we used the KL first class lounge and it was great but on return 5th November it was closed - no reason given but everyone was herded into a small holding lounge to sit out the time. My partner was trying to do some business calls but very difficult sitting neck to jowl with all the other guests. Avoid KL lounge if you can until the closure time is over.,lounge
1413,What a disappointment. This is a small dreary and window-less lounge packed full with passengers awaiting the Frankfurt and Munich departures (leave within minutes of each other). We couldn't find a seat despite arriving in the lounge almost two hours before departure. There are no showers which could have been a nice touch considering the flights to Germany leave at around 3am - an awkward time meaning that most passengers would have long ago checked out of their hotels and be in need of a freshening up particularly after a day of touring hot and humid Mumbai. At least wifi is free (unlike Lufthansa lounges in Frankfurt!).,lounge
1414,Thai is the lounge used for passengers flying on star alliance carriers. Drink selection good but food was simply awful. The noodles were gobbled up so quickly that the staff couldnt keep the dish full! Internet ok and the lounge chairs have been replaced and at least look the part even if some are not particularly comfortable. Not up to the standard I have come to expect from TG lounges.,lounge
1415,Borderline rude staff with more than a slightly condescending attitude and manner. A definite feeling of everything was too much trouble. However once in the lounge the – mostly Asian – staff were relatively friendly and efficient but still lacking. The atmosphere in this very spacious lounge is pleasant and relaxing and knocks spots off any lounge in FRA with the exception of the F Class Terminal. I arrived at 4:40 pm. and only awful-smelling soup and the remains of crisps nuts and the like could be found. At 5 pm. hot snacks were brought out and were surprisingly tasty. Drinks selection is moderately good. Armchairs with low tables and Café-style tables and chairs are available and are kept quite clean. Toilet area clean. Internet access and WLAN. Overall a pleasant experience and a much much better transfer airport and lounge than FRA.,lounge
1416,Lounge had a soft lighting to it being better than the domestic lounge at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It's not big but accommodated well for 2 to 3 flights. Food choices were poor and cheap though: they offered rice meat and vegetables that were simply foreign for the locals. No western cuisine. Seating area was a tad dense in arrangement. A lounge that fits it purpose and a better offering compared to the one at its hub in Kuala Lumpur.,lounge
1417,A long queue to enter the lounge which I simply by-passed rather than stand in line for 15 minutes. Inside the lounge was crowded. Seats are small and cheap looking. My search for a virgin mary was fruitless. No worcester sauce no tabasco no lemon juice etc. I tried a chicken stew which was cold. I left and paid for my own drinks in the main terminal rather than spend any time in the dreary uncomfortable surroundings.,lounge
1418,The lounge is operated by a third party supplier and is shared by numerous airlines. The seating was barely adequate for the number of people present when we were there in the late morning. Facilities are fairly ordinary and the range of catering is limited.,lounge
1419,Worst business class lounge I have ever experienced. Uncomfortable chairs dirty carpet and horrible food service. The front desk receptionists were rude and there is no wireless internet.,lounge
1420,Lufthansa should be ashamed to offer such a dump to their and their star alliance partner business class passengers. Old and run-down furniture empty plates remained on tables for long time and filthy carpets gave me the impression I was sitting in a run-down train station. Only potato salad and some sort of meat dumplings on offer and standard drinks at the self service counter. Lounge (above my SQ flights departure gate B 48) offers nice views of the tarmac but the outdoor viewing area is closed and appears to be closed some time already due to the weeds growing outside. Why wasn't I surprised that no free wireless internet was available but you had to pay for WIFI. Do have to point out that the shower facilities were flawless and very clean and well maintained. This lounge is a major embarrassment for LH in their home hub.,lounge
1421,The lounge is at the very far end of the finger with most intra-Schengen flights and it might well take up to 15 minutes to reach and then the same amount of time again to go to the connection gate. The lounge is very crowded even more crowded than some of the public seating areas one passes on the long way there. Drinks selection is good food is bewilderingly low- standard:e. Newspaper selection good lounge not provide free wireless internet.,lounge
1422,Lounge was quite big with lots of seating. Food was average at best. Washrooms were in very bad condition and not cleaned and organised. No hot water for a shower is unacceptable in a business class lounge!,lounge
1423,Big open-plan lounge that was noisy slightly chaotic and with few quiet spaces to sit and relax. Food was very average and having to queue to get a cup of tea seemed arcane. The air-con wasn't working very well when I was there and it was quite hot and uncomfortable. Furniture looked old and worn as did carpets. The lounge also allowed open entry for 150 Malaysian Ringgit - which seems to defeat the purpose a bit.,lounge
1424,I have been through MH first lounge at KL international airport twice last month. It is a really good lounge. Staff are very friendly and professional always ready to help. Lounge is not big but never crowded when I was there. You can sit down order some proper meals. Great wine and drink selections available. There is also a buffet area you can get the food you like. No spa available in the lounge. Shower is in the bathroom. You can get the tower and amenity from a little counter before get in the bathroom. Good internet connection as well. It is not Qantas first lounge in Sydney but very good lounge for transit passengers.,lounge
1425,A good lounge experience. Centrally located quite spacious relaxed and very clean. Furniture a bit on the sturdy side. Nice staff good views a very good drinks selection. Food less impressive. Very good newspaper selection. Had troubles connecting to internet on my own computer.,lounge
1426,Appalling lounge about 12 seats small no windows even the staff are embarassed by this truly awful lounge. Good selection of drinks and some snacks but this has to rate as the worst lounge I have been in. Flying SWISS First Class but you have to use this lounge as SWISS do not have their own at Boston. Avoid at all costs!,lounge
1427,Arrived at 5am from CAN and was departing at 7am. Terminal 1 lounge not ready drinks only. No cold meats nothing - cold soup though! And in true Lufthansa style no free WiFi! When are they going to get into the 21sr century. Terrible dire. No more Lufthansa flights for me.,lounge
1428,This is not a brand new lounge but with nice decor and great selection of food and courteous staffs. Very speedy and free wifi connection stations for charging mobile phones provided. Bathroom facilities clean and sufficient. A nice place to kill a few hours during transfer as they are not much to see and buy at KLIA.,lounge
1429,The Golden Lounge at Singapore Terminal 2 is basic with a small food and beverage selection and no views to speak of but it was nice and quiet when I visited (7.30pm-9.00pm). There is free WiFi which was very fast I'm not sure how it compares when the lounge is busy. There was a good selection of soft drinks and juices but you have to hunt around for the alcohol (cans of Tiger/Heineken and a wine bottle hidden behind an opaque-doored section of one of the small fridges). Restrooms were clean with shower facilities and towels available. Overall not the best but fine for a short stay.,lounge
1430,Service in this lounge is average there seems to be a constant queue for a shower which is not managed particularly well. The bathroom is poorly maintained in terms of cleanliness and also general condition.,lounge
1431,"I had to ""borrow"" the Internet from the British Airways lounge next door as the only offering the LH lounge had was a pay-by-the-hour t-Mobile connection (nice partnership guys). Many business class customers couldn't even find a seat - you'd think they'd design a lounge to accommodate a 747-400 customer base but apparently not. Plus no windows? I felt like I was in a doctor's office waiting area. Its only saving grace was the ample supply of wine beer and champagne.",lounge
1432,We had a lot of hassle with Lufthansa checking onto our flight. Madrid - Munich - Hong Kong. Their staff do not know how to read E-Tickets anyway once that was sorted I was looking forward to spending some time in the Star Alliance lounge before our flight. However it was not a pleasant experience. The food was peanuts chips club sandwiches and a couple of muffins. The drinks selection was very limited. No bubbles. And the internet was not working. Not a nice lounge at all.,lounge
1433,The lounge is only open to premium passengers from intercontinental flights and elite members of Lufthansa's Frequent Flyer programme (no Star Alliance or partner flights keeping the lounge uncrowded. Luggage stored upon arrival and put my name in for a shower at reception. Experience has taught me to wait for a long time for a shower in the arrivals lounges; not at here. The attendant told me there are 26 showers (plus two on the main level (the lounge spans two levels)). Heated floors grooming supplies available on request (all name brands) and they'll even press your clothes if you're First Class or a gold card holder or above (unfortunately I'm only silver so I can't report on that). Full breakfast buffet upstairs with hot and cold foods comfortable seating recharging station for mobile phones and internet computers. Lufthansa has outdone themselves with this new lounge. The staff informed me that Lufthansa's will open a second Welcome Lounge in Concourse A as part of their redevelopment project.,lounge
1434,We have used the KLIA lounge around 10 times (Adelaide to Europe) in the last few years. It is looking a bit faded and could do with an upgrade but the food is always adequate with respect to quality and variety staff clear the tables frequently and keep everything tidy and the toilets are always clean. Two complaints : It is usually impossible to get a hot shower the water being no better than warm no bath mat is provided and the showers are not wiped down after each use. On the plus side the towels provided are big and white and fluffy. A lot of the seats in the lounge don't have a power point close enough to plug in a laptop so a long wait for the next fight can use a lot of battery power.,lounge
1435,What a tremendous disappointment. Hostess not exactly informed and showed a minimum degree of customer service the lounge was very small (shared by 7 Airlines!) coffee machine overflow when you try to get some zero hot food and they don't even restock the cheap croissant when its finished. And it was only 0930am!,lounge
1436,"Arrived at the Lounge roughly 16.00 on Saturday. Friendly greeting but the lounge was manic and very busy. We had to work out how the system worked as we were not told by the reception staff even though we said we had never visited the Lounge before. Once we figured out the food (hot snacks and cold assortment) and the drinks system, we sat down. The only downside was the air conditioning - it wasn't working. They had very large fans trying to cope with the very hot atmosphere in the Lounge (the lounge faces south with glass windows) but because of the high temperatures, they really couldn't cope. Overall, not a relaxing experience at this time.",lounge
1437,Entered lounge at 20.00 hours on a Saturday. Lounge was very restful and welcoming. Not shown what to do but soon worked it out. Good selection of drinks and snacks available. Lounge was very calming and relaxing - just what we needed before a long flight. This is a good lounge and would recommend it.,lounge
1438,Lufthansa has just recently opened its first arrivals lounge in Frankfurt airport. Its open for premium passengers as well as elite loyalty card holders arriving on long haul flights. Its open from 5am until 12.30 pm and is located just outside the exit of baggage in Terminal 1B. It was bright and staff took care of my luggage and stored it in a secure area. The reception asked me if I needed a shower and directed me to the shower area downstairs. When I went down another staff directed me to the shower room and it was nice to see a welcome note displaying my name on a LCD screen in the shower room! The shower was delightful and had heated granite floors rainforest shower heads Occitane toiletries etc. There was an extensive breakfast buffet with hot items like scrambled eggs pancakes waffles etc and fired eggs could be ordered too. Cup noodles available on request. A lot of cold items like cereals cold cuts cheese etc . Ample dining space free internet via computer terminal snooze areas were other features of lounge. Overall Lufthansa has done an excellent job here and this lounge is far superior than its existing lounges in the departure area.,lounge
1439,Nice new design but always very crowded. Entrance is shared with Business Lounge and toilets are only available in the Business Lounge. Excellent drink selection but food selection is a little bit chaotic. They have a lot of stuff which not really fits together and especially the salads are low-quality convenience products with tons of mayonaise. Only limited offer of cake sweets or chocolate. Extensive offer of national and international newspapers. Actually they had set up a smoothy bar where a bartender made fresh smoothies. Quite a nice idea although the noise of the fruit mixer was quite disturbing.,lounge
1440,The lounge is very small with limited facilities and space. Still the old design which looks a little bit outdated. Drink selection okay but food selection really poor.,lounge
1441,Huge lounge with no character - like a school canteen. None of the finesse expected of a business lounge. All self service poor choice of food - only kind of eggs is scrambled which sit for ages on a hotplate. Hot breakfast choice - chicken sausage scrambled egg and baked beans only. The dining tables and chairs were in the cold buffet section - the low coffee tables and armchairs were the seats for the hot food - who designed this nonsense? At 7am the lounge was not busy but dirty plates cups uneaten food covered the tables. Supervisors just walked past without comment - disgusting. A very disappointing experience at Malaysia's main airport. The only place in Malaysia where the food quality and service has been poor.,lounge
1442,"Excellent service excellent food. Smiles all round from the staff - the chef even made me a Pecan Pastry specially! Very relaxed ambience. Malaysian Airlines at their home base airport of Kuala Lumpur should follow the London example - not the ""school canteen"" style they provide in the KUL business lounge.",lounge
1443,The lounge atmosphere is quite pleasant but there are no windows which makes the lounge feel a little dark and boxed in. The choice of food and drink was okay. Unfortunately the WIFI connection was very poor and I wasn't able to do work on my laptop that I needed to do before the flight. The printer in the computer room wasn't working either which was also frustrating.,lounge
1444,What a difference to the old airside lounge and temporary lounge at Cologne airport! Very good selection of food and drinks with plenty of seating even on a Friday evening. If only all Lufthansa lounges could be like this. This was the Senator/Star Alliance Gold Lounge upstairs so can't comment on the business lounge downstairs but I was impressed at last by a Lufthansa lounge.,lounge
1445,Lounge has seating for about 50 pax but on my visit there were 15 of us comfortable seating nice selection of sandwiches and fruit and a full bar service. The downside to this lounge is having to go into the main Terminal to use the bathroom which was not very clean.,lounge
1446,We found the lounge to be cosy relaxing and the staff excellent. The facilities were very nice we would definitely use this again.,lounge
1447,Arrived in KL at 4am connecting flight out at 9am so would have loved a few hours sleep but the rest room was occupied maybe some more beds could be provided as there are often transiting passengers waiting. However a shower change of clothes and breakfast was much appreciated. Lounge was clean and comfortable but not so clean on our return trip home.,lounge
1448,Excellent lounge with a good selection of food. The lounge was clean spacious and comfortable. Staff very courteous. No alcohol available due to it being a domestic lounge. Loved the decor. Great view of the tarmac too.,lounge
1449,Mid may - and the Golden Lounge is closed - one assumes for renovation. The alternative offered the China Airline Lounge is uncomfortable poorly staffed crowded totally lacking in toilet facilities yet alone showers. Very Poor planning on the part of Malaysia Airlines. They surely could have arranged a better temporary alternative in their Home Airport.,lounge
1450,We have used this lounge before and thought it good but not on the late evening of May 2 this year. I looked around for a bar and finding nothing but a few oddments on a makeshift bar area asked a staff member for help. To my great surprise I was told there was no wine no gin and precious little of anything else! The staff member was curt and unhelpful to the point of being rude walking away while I asked the questions - after six weeks in a country of courteous people this discourtesy astounded me. My husband asked a senior staff member if we could have a glass of wine and was told that the airline was having difficulty getting alcohol through customs. A further problem was that the announcements in the lounge were virtually inaudible so keeping an eye on the departure board was essential. MAS pride themselves on their hospitality but it was sadly lacking in the business lounge that day.,lounge
1451,The Oberoi Lounge is shared by the major carriers (TG LH MI SQ 9W MH etc.) operating out of Chennai. During Peak Hours it is packed and if you arrive late you may not find a seat. The meal options can be described as dismal minimal and definitely most unappetizing. The non-alcoholic options too are somewhat limited. I settled for apple juice and dinner onboard the flight. It just makes me wonder why major airlines have chosen not to set up their own shared lounge.,lounge
1452,"This lounge seemed to go for miles. Very pleasant and welcoming staff at the entrance and also throughout the lounge. Plenty of comfortable armchairs a large selection of food and beveridges plenty of bathrooms a ""quiet"" room for those needing a power nap free internet/wifi connection and for those desperates (like myself) a dedicated smoker's room hidden round a corner right down the back. The floor to ceiling windows provide a great view over the tarmac.",lounge
1453,Very comfortable and quiet lounge. Staff welcoming and friendly. Although it was late at night we were offered a large assortment of snacks finger food etc. and a light hot meal. Plenty of beveridges both hot and cold and a good choice of beers spirits and wines. Bathrooms were very clean with a nice selection of toiletries. A lovely preflight introduction to Malaysia Airlines famous hospitality.,lounge
1454,We were very disappointed and hope that Malaysian Airlines switch lounges. Hopefully there are others with better facilities and services in Rome Airport. At 11.00 am they had run our of clean glasses saying they were all broken. We had to wait for hot glasses from the dishwasher. There was no fruit just some indigestible pieces of foccacia type bread and defrosted rather tasteless sandwiches. Limited supply of juices. Where were the platters of lovely Italian meats and cheeses? The shower was broken. The coffee machine was broken. Only one bottle of wine in an ice bucket. it was a poorly run cafe with one overworked staff member in evidence rather than a business lounge for people who had paid a great deal of money.,lounge
1455,Quality of meals available the lounge seemed to have deteriorated since the last time I used in a few years ago. The hot meal selection was rather cheap. Beverage selection much better with good selection of drinks. Wireless access was slow. They should upgrade to a wider bandwidth. Reception staff were rather unprofessional. They were more keen to grounp around each other and play with their mobile phones. Not what is expected at a business class lounge.,lounge
1456,Have used this lounge on many occasions. It is quite large and generally operates very well with adequate shower/bathroom facilities. On a recent trip were in the lounge from 2230-2400. It was very crowded and not as comfortable or relaxing.,lounge
1457,Small lounge in CDG terminal 1 (run by Air France?) shared by several airlines. It was quiet and felt reasonably spacious with a selection of snacks and pastries but no hot food. Comfortable seating provided. There was also a reasonable selection of beverages (soft and alcoholic). The main negative is that the toliets are outside of the lounge. There were several computers with internet access available throughout the lounge. I could not see any screens that provided flight details but staff made announcements when it was time for boarding.,lounge
1458,Lounge is small but functional. Biggest set back was no toilets which was disappointing as the public toilets were dirty.,lounge
1459,First time in this relatively new lounge at T4. Reasonable selection of food including hot dishes. Wines/champagne of decent quality but I prefer to serve myself or at least have the wines on display. Seating OK but a bit of an odd seating plan - sort of sofas surrounded by single chairs round the edge of the room if that makes sense - better than row after row of the same seats though.,lounge
1460,The lounge in KUL was the highlight of my Malaysia Airlines experience. it was comfortable well-stocked and even had a spa where you can get a reasonably priced massage if you have a longer layover.,lounge
1461,An enormous lounge that provides plenty of comfortable seats with excellent views of the tarmac. There is a self-service bar for alcoholic beverages and soft drinks and a cafe for hot drinks where you can also order freshly prepared meals. The shower facilities were quite good too. Lounge staff were friendly and helpful. Free Wi-fi was provided and there were also a few computer stations with internet access for those who don't have laptops.,lounge
1462,Spacious lounge with ample and comfortable seating. There was a reasonable selection of food and beverages. You also get a nice view of the tarmac. Free Wi-fi and computer stations available. Staff were friendly and welcoming.,lounge
1463,Large and spacious lounge with plenty of seating. Good but busy shower facilities with good supply of towels and accessories. Food and drink well supplied and constantly replenished with good wait staff. Wi-Fi excellent and flight announcements clear,lounge
1464,A very airy clean and spacious lounge located close to runways with excellent views. Lounge has very quiet atmosphere and is calming with plenty of seating. Excellent facilities with high standard of repair showers and rest rooms in immaculate order at time of our visit. Good choice of bakery and cold foods but hot food less appealing and with limited choice. Champagne and other drinks regularly offered by staff that provided great customer service. The best aspect of this lounge is when your flight is ready you are informed and personally escorted straight to the aircraft at Gate 6 a short lift ride away with no waiting or queuing whatsoever.,lounge
1465,MH uses this lounge for their Biz Class passengers. Medium size lounge with easy access and views over the terminal from the first floor. Lounge quiet with soft lighting and good seating. Plentiful supply of reading material and access to departure info via screens. Internet desks available. Good choice of hot and cold food with hot food being constantly replenished. Good choice of beverages and alcohol. Rest rooms and showers in good order and clean. Staff very helpful and cleared surfaces quickly. Flights called over tannoy with short walk to departure gates.,lounge
1466,This is the worst business lounge I have ever been in. There was no fresh food on offer only pre packaged crackers and nuts. The only champagne on offer had a half glass of flat stale champagne in it and apart from that there was only one choice of beer and white wine for Air France you really would expect better. No internet service was offered when I asked I was told to log into my own Air France orange account. Not happy about that. The toilets looked like something out of a derelict Asian department store and accessed from outside the lounge very poor and unclean. The staff were not very welcoming and seemed more interested in getting passengers out of the lounge and to the gate rather than letting them relax. This experience will certainly affect future airline used to fly out of CDG Air France will never be a choice.,lounge
1467,New Business Class Lounge at Heathrow T4 overlooks the Malaysia Gate (Gate 6) - good seating area with plenty of drinks on offer. Food was of 'Malaysian' origin OK but not plentiful. Free WiFi.,lounge
1468,As landed on international flight paid a visit to this lounge before regional connecting flight. Very pleasant lounge with good selection of food/drinks including champagne. Very quiet at time of visit (11am) and outnumbered by staff.,lounge
1469,Access to this lounge was granted as part of my Business class ticket with Oman Air where I believe Oman Air reserve a small room as they don't have their own lounge. The a la carte food provided was good. However the buffet looked like it could have done with a rethink; perhaps more healthy options and fruit as a suggestion. I had a massage in the small spa which I paid extra for but it was excellent. The service was attentive but the quality of alcohol on offer was not the best; no premium whiskey or gin and the wine was a little cheap. The main room of the lounge was very busy in the evening and had it not been for the private room I would have been very disappointed to have been put there. A decent lounge and chance to relax before my flight but not really up to the standard of the rest of the Oman Air service (the flight was excellent).,lounge
1470,Excellent lounge for business class passengers. Very new small but well designed lounge with good facilities. The food and drinks on offer were well presented.,lounge
1471,As the main hub of the airline we found this lounge to be very good and serving it's customers well. Maybe a little frayed around the edges. We had no trouble gaining admission 7 hrs before flight and stayed there the whole time. Good selection of food drinks and reading material. Loved the ice-cream. Even when busy still seemed calm and tranquil. The golf putting room is a great idea and I am sorry did not get to try this. Nice view of the runways.,lounge
1472,Very quiet and east to find. Small range of food but what was there was quite tasty. Good selection of reading material. Beautiful bathrooms. Enjoyed the self service bar. Sure it could be better but there was only 1 flight leaving.,lounge
1473,Fabulous service and amenities in this lounge. Food was plentiful presented well and tasty. The seating comfortable and the staff considerate helpful and courteous. A great way to start a journey!,lounge
1474,Great service plentiful food which was well presented and tasty. Comfortable seating and good amenities.,lounge
1475,Lounge in Bangkok is quite small yet cosy comfortable with a good supply and presentation of food beverages alcoholic and non alcoholic. Lounge in Muscat is fine but re facilities seating. Late night food presentation was not appetising. Breakfast on the return flight was very poor. Not even scrambled egg or anything plain. No toast. All was deep fried and spicy dishes or sweet. I can never connect to their wifi on my Galaxy tab.,lounge
1476,The regional lounge really nice. The food selection is quite good. Nice view where passenger can see the aircraft from a large window. Passenger also can order the food from the chef. The washroom really big and comfortable. They also have a small playground for kids.,lounge
1477,A huge negative is the selection of food or rather lack of. We traveled over a 5 week period & the only hot meal offered that was not a stir fry or curry was potato & leek soup. This did not change over the 5 weeks. The other food offered was average to say the least. At Kuala Lumpur Golden Lounge the only cheese to be eaten with the bountiful supply of crackers was cream cheese! Wraps bagels or small rolls & not much more.,lounge
1478,Large lounge with areas for food drink working TV and resting. Showers newspapers magazines smoking room and quiet area as well as coffee machine. Alcohol (self serve) and snacks with hot food at appropriate times of the day. Seating is modern I doubt if I could doze in them. Staff helpful and as Bahrain is such a small airport all the gates are close. Decent enough lounge for a short stay with views over the airport.,lounge
1479,An excellent lounge. Full restaurant facilities with wide selection of hot & cold food. Full bar inc fizz. Helpful and cheerful Filipino staff. Comfortable range of seating good toilets and full selection of newspapers and magazines. One of the better Business class lounges. A good experience. Note that Oman Air want to board their premium pax by executive bus so don't go to the gate too early or you will be sent back upstairs.,lounge
1480,Oman Air Lounge shared with Gulf Air at DXB T1. Although small it is well furnished and kitted out with large windows overlooking the aircraft standing. All day selection of food and with alcoholic drinks including champagne. Comfortable seating good toilet facilities overall a good business lounge and generally not as full or busy as others in Dubai.,lounge
1481,Very impressive you can tell its almost brand new when you step in. Great large chairs to relax in. Food choices good but they should not serve items like fried fish pieces in a food warmer and have it closed - these items tend to harden up and become a real challenge for your teeth! Drinks selection for alcoholic beverages had a bartender service which you had to use which I dont really appreciate - I would prefer a self service bar but only because I'm more used to it. Noodle bar was very nice. There was also a children's play room Surau Prayer room and a massage service corner- but you had to pay for every treatment or massage available - unlike Thai AIrways BKK massage lounge which gave business class passengers a free 30 min massage. Would have been good if MH offered that. The bathrooms were nice but toilet amenities were not 5 star standard. Previously MH provided L'Occitane and Aigner toiletries but this is no longer the case. In all a great lounge - much much better than the Business class lounge at the satellite building less people which means your chances of getting to use the shower is quite high and also more peace of mind! Only 1 criticism - too many staff on duty - wherever you walk they follow you like as though they're keeping a look out just in case you get up to no good! I know they are only there to see if you need any service but don't overdo it. Some travellers just want some peace and space.,lounge
1482,Lounge is superb! It's far more spacious and impressive than the 1st/ Biz class lounges at the Satellite Building. Great warm and cold food selection good varieties at noodle bar delightful bar selection comfy business centre good natural lighting and viewing area internet stations and fully wifi lounge massage therapy facilities and best of all the bathroom! The shower and amenities are certainly 5 Star!,lounge
1483,Salalah is a small regional airport with maybe 8 scheduled flights a day although a new terminal is under construction. The lounge is upstairs above the single departures area. It is small but comfortable and has a private ladies/family area. Limited snacks and soft drinks (no alcohol) and the toilets are adequate. Newspapers and computer terminal. Lift to descend to departures. No priority boarding it is only 100 yards walk to aircraft steps. The lounge is fine as an alternative to sitting in the small waiting area at departures incidentally adjacent to which there is a small smokers room.,lounge
1484,"A modern and spacious looking lounge with a good selection of food and beverages. We arrived here quite early so took advantage of the ""quiet area"" which has big comfortable chairs and large ottomans so that you can lay down and rest. It is behind a curtain though still fairly bright and can be noisy if seated near the curtain separating the area from the rest of the lounge.",lounge
1485,Business Class passengers are taken by bus to the arrivals hall. Once inside the building follow the signs for the Lounge. You pass through the Duty Free area. We were given a warm greeting upon arrival. The Lounge is quiet and has an extra area with loungers for those that may want to stretch out and have some sleep. The restaurant area offers a good variety of hot & cold meals. A mixture of Western and Arabic foods. Alcohol soft drinks and a coffee machine. You can eat here or take it into the lounge area. The staff were helpful and friendly. There is free internet access . There is a spa too which appears to be free of charge but we did not have time to make an appointment. All in all a very enjoyable experience.,lounge
1486,It is a peaceful place. For much of the time the lounge has few passengers. The quality of food and drink is of a high standard. Staff are helpful. I did experience a problem in using the wi-fi but there were PCs available. The lounge is a pleasant place for a short stopover.,lounge
1487,New lounge opened November 2011. Small but has everything needed. Good selection of food. Seating good with more than sufficient seats for the passengers using the lounge. At present lounge is used only for Oman Air passengers - one flight per day. The facilities are extremely generous for this small usage. If other airlines were to use this lounge it might become too crowded but at the moment it is great.,lounge
1488,Large bar and restaurant with a great seating area overlooking the tarmac. Champagne spirits and decent wine available with a good selection of hot and cold food. Helpful and friendly staff a very relaxing place.,lounge
1489,Great Lounge huge selection of food hot and cold drinks alcoholic and non and hot drinks. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Lounge new and spotless with Wifi and a number of work stations etc. Great place to relax for a few hours.,lounge
1490,A pleasant surprise in sleepy Muscat. spacious lounge with ageing but comfortable sofas. Large big screen TVs free wi-fi access and a great selection of food and beverages. Unlike some Gulf airports there is a selection of alcohol. Snacks included nuts shwarma cheeses tiny sandwiches. Also a wide selection of local and regional newspapers. Only drawback is the lack of shower facilities!,lounge
1491,Muscat has two first/business lounges; one belongs to Oman Air (which Emirates BA etc use) and one belongs to Gulf Air (which in fact is much nicer). The Oman Air CIP is filled with leather sofas and small but tasty snacks. Two giant Plasmas hang on the wall and there are internet terminals. A bar lady serves the alcoholic drinks. Overall very spacious and airy.,lounge
1492,Lounge was almost empty due to early morning. Sandwiches available along with corn flakes. Juices soft drinks tea/Coffee available on request. Computers with internet some magazines and newspapers were provided. Atmosphere quite relaxing.,lounge
1493,PR has no business class lounge in BKK and makes use of Thai's Royal Silk Lounge. The lounge has a tired feel to it with the upholstery of the furnishings worn out cracks in the walls and tiles in the toilets and rather dirty carpets. Food was edible enough with a healthy selection of drinks. In the absence of good places to hang out in BKK while waiting for a flight this lounge would do but am sure they can do better Not the best I've been in but not the worst.,lounge
1494,Food very poor - not catering for western customers could only eat scrambled eggs.No croissants or other edible bread Filipino bread tends to be limited to relatively sweet rolls. No bottled mineral water only purified water from a dispenser. They seem to cater for Filipinos. Urinals in toilets were smelly.,lounge
1495,For such a lounge it's definitely substandard. What I have not found in previous comments/reviews is the washrooms (there are no showers as noted by others) which are tiny! These which are supposed to handle multiple persons are barely larger than those on the aircraft and have a total of two sit type toilets and inadequate room for those waiting or those wishing to wash hands etc. after use.,lounge
1496,"Minimal service and a decor that could generously be described as ""dated"". Food and beverage service was also minimal and it is disappointing especially in a country so strong in the service sector.",lounge
1497,For a business class lounge Manila is definitely sub-standard. Some staff are friendly and helpful others less so. Food and beverage are average. Manila however lacks one of the basic necessities namely showers. The lounge is in urgent need of an upgrade.,lounge
1498,Apart from the friendly greeting when entering this lounge there is nothing good to report. The food was very basic and not that fresh. Coffee lukewarm. Service staff indifferent. Furniture in need of an upgrade facilities basic. It would not take a huge investment to make improvement to this facility,lounge
1499,"This is one of the most ""bland"" looking airline lounge that is in strong need of a major overhaul. Despite this staff were friendly and there was enough food and beverages for travellers. There are no windows and with minimal entertainment despite an occasional DVD played on the big plasma television. Philippine Airlines really need to overhaul and improve their premium services in order to remain competitive.",lounge
1500,Priority pass lounge used by several airlines in Calgary. Lounge is comfortable enough with a selection of refreshments. Please be aware there is no hot food -  except soup - and for this reason I give this lounge a huge fail.,lounge
1501,"Used this lounge with my Priority Pass membership. The food is limited and the room itself is quite small. Shame there are no toilets in the lounge itself, which means you have to leave the lounge then re enter an explain to the staff that you have already signed in. Wouldn't recommend if you are paying for access.",lounge
1502,"The Qantas international terminal business class lounge is a lazy imitation of it's counterparts. There is a lack of service generally, the bar is self service and the variety of food offerings are minimal. The lounge seems to have more in common with the lounge at the leisure destination on the Gold coast than the Qantas lounge in Singapore. Traveling with a young child, I headed for the kids corner to keep our daughter entertained as we prepared for our flight. In this case the 'corner' was very much that, distant from the lounge proper so that a responsible parent flying solo with their kids is unable to get away to the bar or food counter to get any meals without packing everything up and lugging it all with them. There was no offer from the lounge staff to watch our bags, entertain the kids briefly or to bring any food or drinks. What was available in the kids corner was adequate but a few TVs and some toys and beanbags are not especially creative or novel. These small touches make a big difference. While the lounge offers a quiet place to relax before a flight, it could be improved to bring it up to scratch and meet expectations.",lounge
1503,"Food options in the lounge were terrible, and in much need of an upgrade overall which I understand is coming. Very little natural light, and found it quite depressing. Internet was appallingly slow also. Ended up leaving and spending time in the departure. More vibrant, well lit, and much better food options!",lounge
1504,"Lounge was clean, comfortable and staff were very polite and friendly. On our visit on 9 July 2015 there was a high number of children in the lounge (families like ourselves travelling) which made things rather congested given the small lounge size. Unsure if this was usual given it was the end of Australian school holidays. Food was limited, but fresh and of good quality. Once again the lounge was heavily congested, so this may account for the limited availability of food. Lounge was located very close to Qantas boarding gates and only a short distance from a dedicated smoking room which makes things easy if you happen to be a smoker.",lounge
1505,"Business Lounge is very modern. Once you walk into the Qantas Club, the assistant will direct you to a non-see through door that is marked 'Business'. It also labels the access criteria. This feature makes it feel exclusive. The lounge is less than half the size of the Qantas Club, however, it serves more substantial food. It is hard to get into the lounge because you must be flying Business Class or one of Qantas', Emirates, Oneworld Platinum member. The lounge has its own business centre and mini library. It is a big step up from the a Melbourne Qantas Club",lounge
1506,"The lounge is very spacious. I don't get why there isn't a Business Lounge. The usual food choices are available, such as pastas and salads. There is a barista in the morning and from 5pm there is a bar. Boarding calls are made. The lounge can be busy at times because it is also used as an International lounge for Air New Zealand, Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific.",lounge
1507,This lounge is very old and inadequate for the volume of passengers that attempt to enter. At peak times the staff are literally forced to send eligible passengers away due to capacity constraints. Staff often get out their office desk chairs for use of the passengers due to lack of seating. All flights are morning flights so there is an adequate selection of food and drink and the staff are great! Unfortunately though they are constantly having to face the onslaught of disappointed guests who are barred from entry. Qantas have upped their flights but done nothing to sustain the surge.,lounge
1508,This lounge is totally inadequate for the number of people. Was there for the QF 11. Nowhere to sit comfortably people sleeping across 2 chairs long barista queue. As these lounges have now become one world they are beginning to resemble upmarket train waiting rooms,lounge
1509,This lounge was superb. Lots of space with different zones clean great furniture and design good bar area. Qantas/ one world airlines have spent money on this and it is world class. The only gripe is the number of showers- there are too few for the number of passengers arriving from Australia - Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane all arrive at roughly the same time to connect with the New York flight so the wait is too long. Otherwise can't fault this lounge.,lounge
1510,What an awful lounge- crowded awful food and service. The food was sparse it kept running out and took ages before they replenished. No glasses available and when I told the staff she brought out 1 glass for me rather than refill the glass tray! There was even a queue for the toilet. Again too small for all one world customers.,lounge
1511,Qantas really has diminished the value of Club membership. While the staff were very polite and helpful this lounge (like a growing number in the Qantas group) offered little other than a clean place to sit. Hardly worth the extravagant joining and annual fees. Extremely limited offering of food - even less than you would find in a domestic club on the Australian mainland. We ended up buying food from one of the Cafes outside. I managed to get a quick look into a couple of the other Auckland lounges. Qantas should be embarrassed and ashamed of what they offer their Club members.,lounge
1512,Arrived at Sydney airport on Good Friday morning tired and needing a place to rest refresh and have a cup of tea. It was absolute pandemonium in the lounge not a spare seat to be seen families sitting on the floor and an absolute disgrace. This is our worst business class lounge experience in 20 years of international travel.,lounge
1513,Was a relief to visit this lounge after finding our connecting flight was two hours late. Staff was very good from entry to inside. A modern lounge with plenty of spaces to sit and relax. Also was very surprised to find all the reserve table signs be nice if someone explained who they were for. The food wasn't great plenty of beverages.,lounge
1514,Day flight to Singapore the lounge was actually pretty quiet. Food selection (breakfast) was pretty good and actually tasty. Lounge itself is really starting to look old and some of the chairs very ratty indeed. Good selection of local newspapers etc to read staff service was good. Its time to update this Business Lounge it needs a good going over which has been the case now for the past 3 years.,lounge
1515,Compared to Hong Kong Qantas Singapore Lounge is not up to the job. Very sterile place indeed chairs look horrible and are horrible to seat in. Food selection if its Neil Perry its not up to it at all. Bar is good service is okay. Toilets and showers are good whilst there is a good selection of Australian newspapers etc to read. Overall compared to the Qantas Hong Kong Business Lounge the Singapore Lounge falls down badly indeed in terms of looks and quality offered.,lounge
1516,It appears there is only a club lounge at Brisbane Airport and it is an utter disgrace overcrowded. We asked for the business lounge and told that was it many people had to leave as there just wasn't any room. If this is how Qantas treat their business class passengers Ill look elsewhere in future.,lounge
1517,"Great lounge, quiet and lots of friendly helpful staff. Good selection of food in various sections of the lounge. Good shower facilities although I had to wait for about 30 minutes for it to be available.",lounge
1518,It is ages since I have been greeted on entering a lounge with genuinely smiling faces and the offer of drinks. There is a bar serving the signature dish and a choice of good Australian wines. It's a very casual dining option if you dont want to sit at a table. The food was generally good with healthy options available and a menu to reflect time of day.,lounge
1519,Fantastic lounge probably the best we have visited. Very clean & modern staff excellent. A pleasure to visit on a long haul trip to Australia.,lounge
1520,A rather packed lounge with lots of chairs but no view of the apron or runway so boring! Freezing cold (outside was a heatwave) and when I mentioned this a member of staff said that everyone had complained - so do something about it! Several people left to warm up elsewhere. And why not? The food choice was not going to keep them entertained: there was no choice - rice and a stew. Little else in the way of food. Overall rather disappointing when you consider how good Qantas lounges can be (Singapore for example). It felt as if no one cared for the lounge.,lounge
1521,"This is a beautiful lounge - huge with lots of sofas and chairs for rest between your flights. There are very few sleeper chairs around despite its size. The sleepers are found only next to the entrance to the lounge and just above the common area of the airport and near a huge billboard. So despite its intended use, it is not only noisy, you get lots of flashing lights from the nearby huge billboard. Despite having many staff around, nobody comes around to offer you drinks or to top them up. I was at one of the sofa seats downstairs and asked one of the staff if I could get orange juice. His answer  ""upstairs sir"". Not entirely incorrect but not very helpful. As compared to their lounge at Heathrow airport where the staff are not only attentive but much more helpful than these lot at Hamad airport, this lounge just doesn't cut it for me. However, food wise, they've got it covered well. From the restaurant upstairs to the sandwich bar downstairs, it is vey good. A tip for those having meals at the restaurant upstairs - there is a menu from which you can order food if you do not want to take your food from the buffet table - the staff just don't tell you about it until you ask for the menu. The lamb chop and the beef choices are excellent from this menu. The shower facilities are excellent if you can get past the heat - seems that there is no aircon in the shower rooms. Wifi connection is patchy at best. I've never been able to get a connection to view my home and office cameras in all the times that I've been there. I love Qatar Airways. I just hope that service improves at this lounge as I invariably spend a lot of time at this lounge waiting for my next flight.",lounge
1522,"The lounge comfort is basic and acceptable but its too small. Internet is okay, staff are very polite. foods limited, fruits, bread and middle eastern sweet. Good things is the juice are fresh from the kitchen.",lounge
1523,The Qantas Club Lounge was fairly acceptable. Very good food and drink with staff being courteous and unobtrusive. Nice showers except there was no bench or seat on which to sit down whilst putting on my shoe. The décor deliberately industrial was not inviting or comforting. Seats were OK but not great.,lounge
1524,As an Emirates platinum member I am able to access the Qantas first lounge while travelling on Emirates from New Zealand to Dubai during my stop-over in Melbourne. It is not a massively large lounge but has never been overly busy when I have visited and in fact has been very peaceful. The restaurant is excellent offering great food and quick service. The staff are brilliant without being obtrusive. I prefer this lounge to any Emirates lounge and enjoy the peace and quiet.,lounge
1525,Overcrowded dark noisy dirty full of rude passengers and overwhelmed staff. Was served scotch in a glass fresh out of the dryer so scalding hot. Was cut in queue at showers twice by pushy women with kids in tow staff helpless to enforce numbers as no one on desk. Has opened before it is ready and without adequate staff to provide service required of an international business lounge.,lounge
1526,"This is a new lounge at a new airport so very impressive. A good design feature is that it's right in front of you when you come through transfers so no long walks trying to find it! There's a nice check-in area with lots of lovely Qatar staff, then you go through to a nice water feature. There's a buffet restaurant with a la carte menu and bar above up a nice spiral staircase and a 'make your own' sandwich and salad bar in the opposite direction all serving alcoholic and soft drinks. There's self-service coffee machines and tea dotted around. There's a hideous smoke room for smokers, lucky I'm not. You won't need to light up, just walk in and breathe. Overall a good place to rest between flights with showers, free wifi, a nice quiet zone and I think I saw a children's play area. The duty free shops are down a long escalator below.",lounge
1527,"I experienced Qatar Airways London Heathrow and Doha lounges which were fantastic in every way from the food to rest rooms. This handling lounge in Singapore was a shock, the food on offer was dry and looked like it been sitting there a long time. Certainly could do with spending some money on the interior.",lounge
1528,This was a sectioned off area of ,lounge
1529,Qantas uses this as a shared airport lounge probably no choice. I suspect this was a oneworld shared lounge. Staff couldn't care less. The toilet had been broken into as the main door handle and lock were falling off the door. For an international lounge the food and drinks were woeful. The internet connection was difficult and rarely worked when connected just gave up on it. I wouldn't recommend it but there is no choice unless perhaps you use one of the paid lounges eg Priority Pass might be better. Seats were torn and the filling was coming out of many. At least it did have a flight status monitor. No blaring and annoying TV was a bonus. For an international shared lounge the reading material was very limited ie basically non existent.,lounge
1530,I know it's Sunday morning but might the staff smile and acknowledge passengers? I always thank staff for clearing tables etc. and generally get at least an acknowledgement if not a short conversation. Today - nothing. Not hugely impressed as it's far better during the week.,lounge
1531,Typically disappointing Qantas lounge. Crowded grumpy staff and passengers sprawled everywhere with luggage blocking seats. I noticed many tables had reserved signs - in all my years of travel with Qantas I was not aware that it was possible to reserve tables in the lounge. Food was generally ok but long since cooled down. Plenty of alcohol but no bottled water.,lounge
1532,"Great lounge, open and spacious with a decent restaurant on the upper floor. Food was of good quality and staff were pleasant and well trained.",lounge
1533,"On my outbound flight from LHR to AUH via Doha I was allowed access to the fantastic main Qatar lounge. However, on my return to LHR just 7 days later I was told to use a smaller lounge for oneworld frequent flyers. I was dissapointed with this change in policy, as were other passengers. The smaller frequent flyer lounge has uncomfortable seating and very poor selection of food.  Undermines the point of belonging to a frequent flier programme with lounge access. On my return to the lounge at 3pm I was told they had ran out of champagne and spirits apart from Bacardi. There would be no more until a store was to be opened at 9pm. The point of going for an indirect flight with Qatar was because I had thought I would be looked after in the lounge. It seems this is no longer the case.",lounge
1534,Just visited the new Qantas club in Darwin and it was fantastic and such a huge improvement from what was there previously. The design is modern with many seating options available. The buffet was well set up and the staff were clearing by tray which looked and felt premium. I enjoyed a barista coffee then took a shower prior to my flight in a very comfortable shower room. Everything was perfect and was matched by the engaging staff to welcome me and then farewell on boarding with a bowl of mints nice touch. Great work with this new lounge Qantas.,lounge
1535,Used this lounge flying into Australia. We entered the lounge probably about 9.30 at night and there was hardly anyone in there - probably no more than thirty people. The place is huge very stark and industrial looking. As we were flying Jetstar I wisely decided to eat before the flight. Plenty of food on offer and ate from the hot buffet black pepper chicken and delicious crispy skin mashed potato. My friend had the pasta and was equally delicious all washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne. Went back a little later and had individual desserts the best creme brulee I have had a really good chocolate mousse and a liqueur. Staff were very pleasant a comfortable place albeit a bit cold due to air con temperature but well worth the visit.,lounge
1536,What a lovely lounge. Very pleasant surprise plenty of space lots of good food and drink to hand toilets and showers very clean. WIFI good as well great choice of current magazines as well as newspapers from around the world. Overall a much improved lounge in HK International. Made flying economy back to Brisbane overnight that much more pleasant.,lounge
1537,As a Qatar gold member I am disappointed at the change in lounge at Doha airport back to the older previously temporary lounge. This lounge is not only too small and noisy but also crowded and uncomfortable with a poor selection of food and drinks. I have no doubt that these sentiments will be echoed by other Privilege gold members and I hope that Qatar Air reconsiders this change in order to maintain its reputation as an airline offering superior customer service.,lounge
1538,Al Mourjan lounge at Hamad airport in Doha is really impressive. However missing the old Business and First Class Terminal. It is so huge and far from many gates. I prefer the LHR Qatar Airways lounge. Cozy and more quiet. The restaurant/food were amazing. Very spacious and luxury seating area. However if you are looking for a chaise longue in the quiet area be patient - there was a huge waiting list. Also they forget to install A/C in the shower rooms. So don't have a too long and hot shower because you will be sweating afterwards.,lounge
1539,Best lounge I have ever been through Heaven Class. Could not fault the place Great food and Bev staff all helpful and pleasant. There is any amount of food choice and okay WiFi. Anyone who complains about this lounge is simply impossible to please.,lounge
1540,This lounge needs to be revamped as its showing its considerable age. The food selection has much improved when we were taking our day flight to HK. Hot breakfast meal available which was very good along with the freshly made to order coffee. Only gripe was the Apple Mac would not work and the staff could not get it to work either. Good selection of current magazines and newspapers to read though.,lounge
1541,Very Clean good choice of drinks and food easy access to services limited operating times good to have a few drinks before the long haul to Sydney or Brisbane.,lounge
1542,Outstanding we felt as if our holiday had begun at Heathrow. The quiet understated luxury was wonderful nothing was too much trouble food was amazing staff were polite and respectful. (Unlike Phuket Business Lounge where it was help yourself to a pot noodle).,lounge
1543,Find negative comments about staff strange. We were waited on the whole time we were there. Most of staff were from Nepal and were very friendly. Good selection of food. We take on board about ordering sandwiches. Only real negative comment the lounge was a long way from our gate apparently 1km. No walk ways meant we had to rush to the gate. Perhaps you should consider having a board giving approximate walking times to the various gates.,lounge
1544,Used the (almost) new LAX Oneworld lounge for the first time. Not having experienced the previous one I'm guessing this is a vast improvement on what it replaced judging from the publicity. Decor is pleasant & modern with good bar / food facilities (if very cramped). Biggest problem is the First lounge isn't yet finished. As a result the new lounge is like an overcrowded food court with people using chairs as tables and footrests for sleeping that's if you can find a spare chair. The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only 9 showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark. Here's hoping the new First lounge makes amends when finished.,lounge
1545,I had a late PM flight with a OneWorld partner. The lounge was quite empty but it had a lovely ambience. I didn't really pay much attention to the food due to how late it was but I had a small plate of cheese and some lovely sparkling wine (and then a Jamieson as a night cap). It was extremely welcoming and lovely to be away from the disaster that is currently Brisbane International Airport with the renovation happening on L3. The bathroom was spotless and the few staff around were pleasant enough.,lounge
1546,The lounge is pretty spacious with plenty of seating. I arrived at 3:30 pm for a 5:30 flight so had a good couple of hours here. Bar has a very good selection with some nice red and whites. A good selection of beer both local and international. Also a good selection of spirits and liqueurs. The food on the other hand is terrible. Qantas should be ashamed to offer this level of food to business customers. You could be forgiven in thinking that you are eating a sizzler. Actually that would be better. The toilets are clean but the place has a little bit of age. If you are paying a Qantas club lounge membership then you will be disappointed. Auckland airport in general is better fitted out than the lounge.,lounge
1547,Long narrow lounge. Bar a long way from food. Easy to miss the bar Noisy. At least we got a seat. Puzzled why we are sometimes sent to different lounges. Food nothing special. Airport a nightmare.,lounge
1548,Whilst there is a lot to be admired about this lounge it is clearly designed for business people who have 3 hr+ stopovers at Doha. I'm sure the a la Carte restaurants are excellent but my wife and I had less than 2 hr stopover and after you've made the lengthy walk from the gate had a freshen up etc the only thing we had time for is a cool beer and a selection from a quick and easy 'help yourself 'buffet (sandwich etc). The trouble is that this does not seem to exist because the food and drink section is located at the far end of the lounge and you have to put in orders for tailor made sandwiches. We did not have the time for that so downed a beer and left. Surely it would be possible to put a small selection of buffet sandwiches nachos crisps nuts etc for people who were in our position ? The lounge gets very busy around 11pm to 1 am and it was pretty difficult to find two seats together during that time though when we left it was a lot less crowded.,lounge
1549,Wasn't expecting much. No natural light but there was a decent selection of hot and cold food. I just had some fresh fruit cake and water. All very pleasant. I was called to the gate 70 minutes before departure this was too early as I was just hanging about the gate which was too hot and had awful Mosquitos flying about.,lounge
1550,Qantas' International First Class Lounge/Sydney Airport is one of the most best lounges i have experienced aside from Cathay's Hong Kong First Lounge. The separate dining area is amazing with many options and the personal attention is wonderful. Even later as I was there for a few hours prior to flying to Dallas I had some items from the self-service area which to me was quite an assortment of snacks to small meal-like offerings and beverages galore. Separate areas for computer use relaxing the library and of course views of the planes with floor to ceiling windows create private yet open feel.,lounge
1551,I was looking forward to this lounge as it was the first time in Singapore. I thought I was walking into a cafeteria all hard surfaces and noisy. The seating area was not that comfortable low hard chairs with low tables. The shower and toilets were ok but I was travelling with a friend who had been there before the renovations and said that these had not been touched. Another thing is the dress code (or lack of it) - some travel as if they are going to the beach. I'm talking of singlets shorts and throngs can't they buy a $5 t-shirt at least and a pair of joggers. Come on Qantas lift your game.,lounge
1552,An absolute gem of a lounge. Sit at the bar or relax in a comfy seat & enjoy the waited service the choice is yours. There's a choice of informal dining from the Deli or eat in the Brasserie - I chose the fillet steak with peppercorn sauce. When the food & drink takes its toll the 'facilities' are of quality hotel standard. All lounges should use this place as their blueprint; simply outstanding.,lounge
1553,On arrival the lounge looks spectacular. But it is too big and loses its exclusive feel. There are some comfortable leather sofas but too many of the seats are uncomfortable. There are two restaurants serving good buffet food which is of good quality but the Heathrow Qatar lounge has a superior offering with cook to order dishes. As Qatar Airways treats this airport as a hub with potentially long transit periods then a few more facilities should ideally be provided such as a spa and lounger type seating allowing you to have a more comfortable sleep. After paying good money for a business class flight I don't feel I should have to pay good money for a transit hotel. As M Clarke mentioned in the review below  there are loads of staff who hang about doing not a lot I don't want to be fussed over but it would be nice to be offered a drink or something. Overall a good lounge but underwhelming maybe I was spoilt at the Qatar Heathrow lounge but I think this lounge could do better given all the hype on their website.,lounge
1554,A fantastic lounge the best I have visited and in my opinion better than the Al Mourjan lounge at Doha which I visited on my arrival. The restaurant was amazing with made to order dishes and superb dessert station - I don't have a sweet tooth but just couldn't resist. Very spacious and luxury seating area with staff taking your drinks orders. A minor and amusing point was the waiter (who claimed he was the barman) had never heard of port I explained it was similar to sherry but he was still unsure what I was on about (he sounded eastern European) in the end I settled for another glass of Bollinger champagne.,lounge
1555,Used this lounge as an Emirates customer. Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from 4 slices of cheese on 3 plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help! No announcements in English - fine for me but not so great for those who don't speak either Arabic or rapid French. Really poor!,lounge
1556,A very large space with lots of seating and a smoking area at one end of the lounge. Two bars but with nothing on display and no staff to serve. Food appeared after sometime but was inedible sandwiches dried out and who knows what was inside.,lounge
1557,Very poor variety of food and drinks available. Cheeses were tasteless and bread rolls did not taste fresh. If you want something tasty eat before you get to this lounge. Very very quiet which some will see as a bonus.,lounge
1558,New Qantas lounge in Terminal 1. Excellent facilities including spacious and clean showers bar with beer on tap adequate selection of wines and spirits and a barman to serve you. Extensive selection of hot and cold food including a choice of 2 dishes made to order and served to you in the dining area.,lounge
1559,Overcrowded great barista coffee and accompanying muffins avoid the basic boring usual items and wait for the good stuff on the plane. Breakfast is the usual fair chipolata sausages cold hash browns soggy tomatoes. Lunch is usually soup and a selection of rolls. The food in here doesn't match the decor even if it is hard to find a seat! Friendly staff make up for the lack of choice in food and beverages are pretty good.,lounge
1560,First things first - to go to the loo when you arrive (not an uncommon destination I think) you have to go up a long ramp and then down another long ramp diagonally opposite then double back on yourself and walk another 30/40 feet; this is bonkers. Every time I arrive here I try a different seat - there is not a single comfortable seat in the place; there are a couple of nice leather sofas that look really nice but I've never been able to get near them because they're always 'full'. There are weird modern seats (very 60s - they look great) that are too low and you have to virtually lie in them or odd seats (that are at least higher) with big 'conservatory type' surrounds but they really aren't that comfortable. Then there are the seats beside the very fancy looking computer monitors that are at a completely unrealistic angle for use but although these seats look vaguely comfortable it's like sitting in a corridor. There isn't a scrap of carpet anywhere that I can see. There's what looks like a nice restaurant about a quarter of a mile away (seems like with the up and down ramps) and several tea and coffee stations and then at the opposite end to the restaurant is a deli. The old Ppremium terminal at Doha was lovely - nice people would pass by and ask if you'd like a sandwich and bring it to you with a glass of something. This place is absolutely crawling with really lovely helpful staff but they don't seem to actually do anything. Worst of all there is NO SPA free or otherwise unless you check into a hotel no hairdresser either. For a lounge purporting to be world class this is way off I think. I would happily pay for a massage and a shampoo any day of the week but there's nothing. I spoke to a member of staff this evening and was bemoaning the fact that you have to zigzag all over the place to get anywhere and that I loved the old lounge and she said she couldn't count the number of people who had said that. I love Qatar Airways but this lounge is a bit of a fail for me - a great shame because I spend about 4 hours here every couple of months.,lounge
1561,Qatar Airways is a spectacular company dealing with distinction its premium passengers. The lounge for business class is the best I have met in the world. Must impeccable service Krug and all the delicacies of the company's staff of care. Are to be congratulated.,lounge
1562,Qatar Airways is a spectacular company however this Sao Paulo Airport executive class lounge used by the company is awful. All companies of the OneWorld use this lounge in the new T 3 in GRU. The catering is horrible the drinks have few options and low quality.,lounge
1563,I guess if you come from Sydney or Melbourne you are spoilt by the QF first class lounges which are amongst the best anywhere particularly on the catering front and I also guess you shouldn't expect anything special airline wise in the US but really the all in one world first class lounge in Lax is pretty ordinary. Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the 5th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the 3rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.,lounge
1564,Spacious uncrowded. Great food options including two made-to-order signature dishes reflecting the best of local cuisine styles in a lively eating area. Try a Singapore Sling - the equal of Raffles Long Bar version. Quieter lounge zone available for relaxing or laptop use. Fast Wi-Fi. Customer service service outstanding.,lounge
1565,Qantas International Business Lounge in Sydney. Lounge was very spacious very clean and staff very attentive with service and cleaning of the lounge. Lounge wasn't very busy which was a surprise. Food on offer was okay not great some more offerings would be good Beverages on the other hand were great. They had my beer on tap (Fat Yak). Overall pleasant experience and good relaxation before any long haul flight.,lounge
1566,At present probably the best lounge in the world matches and exceeds other first class lounges. Modern extremely spacious food and drink selection simply amazing. Modern architecture all perfectly organized.,lounge
1567,Had a long layover here. Lounge is super impressive as far as the aesthetics go and the range of different seating options is good. The food was of a good standard: I ate upstairs and went for the mezze option rather than the a la carte. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I wanted somewhere to sleep and was lucky enough to get one of the quiet area cells. Not very comfortable but I was able to get a few hours sleep and a shower before the next leg of my flight. Overall a really good experience: felt much less busy and cluttered that the equivalent in Dubai.,lounge
1568,I was disappointed and alienated by the huge lounge sections which lack any cosy atmosphere and personality. Facilities are there but not always easy to find or access. A desert of steel glass and marble. It is far too big.,lounge
1569,For years this lounge has shared what must be a 56k dial-up Internet connection. For business travellers hoping for last minute skype e-mail etc before the 14-15hr flight back to oz forget it. Better staying in AA T4 and catching a late shuttle to Tom Bradley. It is consistently (6 times per year since this new lounge format opened) so bad I cannot begin to describe.,lounge
1570,The lounge was great a friendly engaging welcome on arrival from the team at the desk. The lounge was very clean and tidy well stocked with newspapers and magazines. The buffet was well presented and I noticed the staff replenishing and tidying the food spills. Barista coffee was superb and the young lady serving had a keen interest in her customers. A great experience in a comfortable lounge which reminded me why reminded me why I fly Qantas.,lounge
1571,Was surprised how crowded the lounge was. Had trouble finding a seat. Good selection of food and drink and a pleasant view onto tarmac. Seating comfortable.,lounge
1572,The business class lounge is horrible for more than 1-2 hours. A 7 hour layover is an ordeal given the absence of facilities for lying down to sleep. If you find the quiet area tucked away just off the main dining area there are no loungers or blankets or pillows - but I was offered pyjamas! The room reverberates - too much stone metal and wood. The facilities are spotless and staff very polite and helpful.,lounge
1573,This has to be one of the most dramatic interior spaces at any airport anywhere. The size of at least several football fields with several levels it is both restful and convenient. While we sampled just a bit of the food the mezze and the rest looked wonderful. We were there mid- morning and the space seemed almost empty. Staff were terrific helpful and informative.,lounge
1574,I was in transit for almost 9 hours so delighted that the lounge is now fully operational. As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water. I'd just finished changing the phone and reading the printed copies of the UK newspapers when staff told me that breakfast was being served in the upstairs restaurant. All the staff were helpful and friendly.,lounge
1575,Qantas have now rescheduled most Asian flights for mid morning departures. Also departing at this time are flights to all New Zealand airports and South Africa!! Plus don't forget all the One-World and other carriers that also use this Lounge. You do not need to be a genius to work out that this means massive over-crowding in one small time slot. Yet another diminution of the Qantas brand. A previously really good lounge with great food services and staff but never designed for the traffic in this time slot.,lounge
1576,Unlike the scrum of the Qantas club through the door the business lounge at Melbourne seemed very sedate. We arrived at that time in-between breakfast finishing but being too early for lunch so there weren't too much food options available for us. The lattes were expertly made I have to say but would have been nice to have had some sort of biscuit/cake to go with them. Soft drinks were via a soda dispenser but the glasses are tiny - more designed for adding a mixer to alcohol than for someone wanting just a pure glass of Sprite. Plenty of magazines/newspapers to read or you can watch the world go by looking out the big windows that overlook the gates. Free and unlimited wifi was available in the lounge.,lounge
1577,Had a 2 hour visit to this lounge courtesy of Air New Zealand. Lots of seating with armchairs sofas and dining areas. Several TV screens with 2 large surrounded by comfy seating. Several shower/toilets well maintained and clean although unsure if how to get a towel if you needed a shower. There was a selection of drinks including spirits soft drinks and coffee/Tea. Overall there was a nice feeling to the lounge light roomy and welcoming. Unfortunately food was lacking in choice cold selection was ok salad cold meat and cheese. As for the hot food there was curry and nothing else. No choice and no rice to accompany the dish. This must be the worst business lounge for hot food choice anywhere. As for dessert there was a choice of chocolate brownies and lollies. Once again very disappointing. This would definitely put me off using Qantas Business class especially as this was the international Lounge. Overall good if you want to have a drink and relax but Don't go in to eat.,lounge
1578,The lounge is a great place to stay to pass the time between flights. The lounge offers wonderful food plentiful drinks and the wonderful showers.,lounge
1579,This lounge is very spacious and comfortable there are many areas and dining options. The staff are very helpful. But there is a problem with the lack of toilet facilities first time I've seen a queue for the gents. In general very good but I still prefer the old premium terminal.,lounge
1580,The lounge didn't feel exclusive and too overcrowded. Lounge open to noise of the rest of the terminal and very difficult to find. Had breakfast and food offering was extremely bland. I expected so much and was very disappointed. Compared to the Premium Lounge at LHR this is a joke.,lounge
1581,A zoo. Used the lounge on 6 July 0830-0930 en route to Singapore. The place was packed to the rafters and seating difficult to find tables a mess of post breakfast debris and the decor is really showing its age - especially if you compare it with the First Class lounge next door. Australians are great lounge users through the QF Club membership scheme consequently international BC lounges are heavily used by economy travelling but club member passengers. Domestically Qantas has come to realise that Business class paying passengers deserve their dedicated lounges away from the scrum of the club it's now time Qantas realised that international customers paying a hefty premium to stay loyal to Qantas.,lounge
1582,Visited early May and was surprised by the experience after reading some bad reviews for LAX. I assume this was the new lounge in the Tom Bradley terminal. There were 3 large screen TV's with NBA MLB and NHL being televised. Bar service great with loads of choice as well as a self service area. More than enough space before our flight to Sydney at 10.10pm in the evening with a number of laptops available. Food selection not quite as good as Emirates Lounges but still adequate. Definitely recommend.,lounge
1583,Poor air conditioning lack of food choices terrible internet (spent 45 minutes trying to download 17 emails and never actually managed it). Even the on-table tablets couldn't connect to the internet. Very poor in comparison to the old premium lounge.,lounge
1584,Qatar Airways new business class lounge is up and running and is quite exceptional. A simpler more elegant version of Emirates lounge in Dubai. I was there when it was not very crowded so it will be interesting to see what it's like when it is full - that was the worst part of the old premium lounge. The lounge has 2 dining facilities several snack areas and bars lots of seating a business area and as with its old premium lounge a lot of staff being helpful. Big and airy it is open to the new terminal but the noise did not seem to be a problem. There are numerous zones for seating broken up by architectural screen walls interior plantscaping and changes to the floor level. Most seats have a touchpad for announcements and surfing and a small set up of bottled water and simple snacks. Aesthetically the design is flawless.,lounge
1585,Expected more from the temporary lounge it is not close to the standards of the lounge at the old airport. Only 5-6 tables for eating the rest are small narrow tables with two electric outlets placed between two armchairs not enough room for two to place plates.,lounge
1586,I fly in and out of Singapore on business frequently and naturally I was keen to visit the newly renovated Qantas lounge. Whoever designed this lounge has obviously never had to do business in an airport lounge. It has been transformed into a noisy cafeteria styled open lounge. The hard surfaces (walls and floor) create a vast noisy cavern with no consideration for acoustics. Qantas has completely overlooked the business class traveller here. There are no work stations or desk areas and if you need to print anything you have to go to the check in desk to collect your private and personal documents. I'm standing at a chest height bar trying to use the laptop as every table is full. If I sit down my hands are at shoulder height trying to type. Despite a good bar and what looks to be a good food selection this lounge is no better than the basic Qantas Club lounge in Sydney or Melbourne.,lounge
1587,Although the first class lounge has been in operation or a few years now and the standard of service in the restaurant is first class (run by Sofitel) the amenities provided (moisturiser razors etc.) have all but disappeared. There wasn't even a toothbrush to be had and I had to go to the desk to ask for one. Considering what one pays for business and first class with Qantas compared to some other airlines I would have expected better.,lounge
1588,Got a complimentary Qantas Club pass from my partner to use on my trip SYD-SIN-SYD last month. Decided not to use it on the lounge in Sydney Int'l Airport as it is always crowded but on Singapore Lounge. My choice proved me right the new lounge is great there are more seats inside the lounge with power supply and USB charging. Staff fabulous and tables are cleaned when guests left. Bars well stock and the buffets and menu are good.,lounge
1589,The temporary lounge is a real shame compared to the previous one : overcrowded poor choice of food and drinks. Terrible when you have many hours of transit in the middle of the night. No wifi dedicated to the lounge but Airport free wifi very slow.,lounge
1590,Business class lounge was full with no where to seat. Very limited food.. Refused entry to the Oryx even though there own website states I should have been allow in.,lounge
1591,The business class lounges at the new airport in Doha are sill under construction and won't be open for another 3 months a fact you will only find out at checking as we did. There is a temporary first and business class lounge but access is highly restricted due to their limited space and normal oneworld status privileges don't apply. The temporary first class lounge is cramped hot offers a coffee machine with a few snacks. If you are going to be in transit for any length of time recommend you avoid the temporary lounges and head to the transit hotel instead or stay in the main concourse where it's cooler and less congested. I am very surprised that they didn't put the building of their new premium lounges as a priority prior to the new airport opening.,lounge
1592,Sydney International Business lounge is spacious with a modern decor. Around 13:00 once the lunchtime flights to LAX and Singapore depart it's quiet. The informal 'island dining' was pleasant and there were additional food buffets - including a very tasty Fijian style goat curry. The gelato bar was a nice touch - only 6 varieties but a nice after meal palette cleanser. There are ample Australian wines (no Champagne) top shelf spirits (but no malt whisky) international and Australian beers and soft drinks. A barista is present to make coffees. The staff were extremely pleasant - perhaps because of the early afternoon lull they had more time to interact with the few passengers waiting for the late afternoon flight to Dubai/LHR and were happy to have a chat. The vista is nothing special - though you can watch plane movements across the apron if that's your thing. Altogether a pleasant and enjoyable experience and a nice way to start a holiday.,lounge
1593,Had Use of this lounge on the way to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Min City as Vietnam Air and Qantas codeshare on this leg of the Trip. It may need a bit of an update with furnishings but the staff and food are way above most other lounges. The most impressive thing in this lounge is the showers and the selection of drinks both Alcoholic and non. People who complain should visit the Star Alliance lounge in Frankfurt or one of the lounges at Gatwick.,lounge
1594,Excellent new lounge for Qantas at Singapore. High quality service with skilled and welcoming staff. Very good range of food and drinks catering to all tastes. Personalised level of service unique to usual lounge experience.,lounge
1595,Cost for the Oryx lounge is 40USD. Given the state of Doha airport whilst the new one is being constructed I think it well worth the money. Showers alone after a long haul are worthwhile and the buffet whilst simple is plentiful and the coffee good. Spacious clean and plenty of seating.,lounge
1596,The Premium is huge but there are often too many passengers using it. Staff are very courteous and tried very hard and found tables for us in minutes. Lots of choices in buffet food and drinks. However quality on soup and hot dishes are so-so. Arabian snacks are impeccable and are worthy to try. Lots of bar stands for bar services. Bathrooms are spotless as staff will clean all stations before another passenger will use the toilet. The game room was closed and no one was there. The playroom lacks facility and was not attended. There is a Duty Free just for premium customers but there are not many exciting goods there. Generally cannot fault the Premium Terminal. There probably is not a better lounge than QR's Terminal. However they have raised the expectation too high that it is hard to meet the expectation. Hopefully they will have a larger Premium Terminal when new airport opens as they need a terminal that is at least 4 times larger than this one to make it a comfy lounge and allow them to continue to expand.,lounge
1597,Check in staff were no help in locating airside lounge. Shared with other carriers it was comfortable but offered poor selection of food and beverages. Bright with airfield view.,lounge
1598,A pleasant enough place to take a break for an hour or so and I was flying on a very cheap business class fare so was reasonably happy but if I had been paying full price I think I would have expected more from this lounge. Very small space with limited food choices but what was there was pleasant enough. Instructions on how to use the coffee machine would have been helpful.,lounge
1599,A very good business class lounge. The food was excellent and the hot showers that my wife and I had was great and very refreshing. WiFi was great and the staff were more than willing to help.,lounge
1600,Compared to the excellent Business Lounge the First Class Lounge does not offer any additional value. It's smaller and at certain times quite full. I would recommend the Business Lounge next to it if it's too full in the First Lounge.,lounge
1601,"The new lounge in hadn't opened on our way thru to HKT on 8th April but had by the time we came back on 16th April. What a disappointment! Being Platinum I was led to believe it was like the brilliant First class lounge in Sydney. Not so. How about no computers or showers! How about sitting cafeteria style with bowls of buns in spots along the table where you would have to request another diner to ""pass the bread please"". It really is just so average. We had to go back to the BA lounge to use a computer. I thought it was a First class lounge but it is open to everyone from Qantas Club to Business class and everyone in between by the look of it. On the other hand the staff were fantastic and will obviously enjoy working in their new environment.",lounge
1602,The lounge hot menu is Chinese. I am confused as to why Qantas feed their Australian business only Asian food. The only other things we could eat were Thai spring rolls with no taste. The drinks were nice and so was the fresh fruit. One Asian option is OK but everything?,lounge
1603,Qatar Airways uses in Milano (Malpensa) the Sala Montale lounge (B-pier non-Schengen) for their premium frequent flyers and business class passengers. The lounge is marvelous. Its new interesting design gorgeous view of the airport aircrafts’ trafficking just outside the huge panorama windows overlooking starts and landings and a handful of international gates. The lounge is very clean. Furniture composition and art provide an elegant mixture of privacy and plenum options for travelers. On the minus is a stunning lack of hot dishes the only hot dish available is instant noodles. Snacks are many and drinks are even more inclusive of Italian champagne (spumante). Fruits and juices are plenty and coffee machines likewise. Italian cheeses salamis minipizza’s etc. could also have been a nice addition. Toilets lack shower but are well designed. WiFi is a bit tricky to connect to but works well once connected.,lounge
1604,LHR lounge deserves the rave reviews. Excellent restaurant quality food and service with a knockout wine list. Lunch of crayfish washed down with a premier cru bourgogne! Absolutely no skimping on anything and everything works. Delightful staff with a sense of humour. Faultless. We felt vaguely guilty about such luxury! Doha premium terminal was busier but not far behind in quality. We had no trouble finding quiet seating on both visits. Both lounges are better than any others we have used in the last decade. The bus transfers to and from aircraft are a minor issue and actually interesting; problem solved shortly with the new terminal.,lounge
1605,Outstanding ambience service food and wine. The staff were very attentive and polite and absolutely charming.,lounge
1606,This lounge takes you back to the 1970's. Although it's clean and tidy it's certainly not up to world standard. Some of the lounge chairs were very uncomfortable.,lounge
1607,Nice new lounge with enough seating for all at peak morning period. The staff were great with a level of service lacking in the bigger Qantas lounges. Food the same as everywhere else adequate but some variety would be appreciated.,lounge
1608,Had the opportunity to use the newly opened Qantas lounge at Changi on the 10th of April and cant say that I was overly impressed at all. Cold uninviting and lacked any atmosphere at all. The staff however are wonderful and made up for what the lounge itself lacked. Am wondering who may have designed the space and secondly who approved it I expected Qantas to come up with a lot better.,lounge
1609,A very small but very clean lounge. Packed out as we awaited our flight back to Sydney at 10am from Honolulu. Service excellent food selection okay drink selection ditto. Toilets very clean. Only downside is the lounges wifi and business pc's both as slow as a wet week badly in need of upgrading particularly the 3 PC's. Good selection of Australian magazines and newspapers.,lounge
1610,First visit arrived from Hong Kong 0505 : huge airy lounge relatively low crowd plenty of lounge chairs & tables available. Hot buffet meals in restaurant area looked ok but I didn't sample. Food/bakery in lounge area had a small selection including breads cheeses yoghurts olives meat slices etc. Disappointed a true cappuccino wasn't available no decaf tea or coffee. Toilets staffed with several cleaners was very good. I enjoyed a refreshing shower. Second visit very busy took a little time to find a table. WiFi worked well. Toilets busy very clean as cleaner checked briefly after each person. Small dessert slices quite nice. Much more variety and quantity in lounge bakery - excellent. Still no cappuccino nor decaf available from bar. Overall an impressive lounge in layout and style but no decaf tea or coffee.,lounge
1611,A tale of 2 halves. Arrived outbound around midnight the lounge was packed and had to ask a member of staff to help in locating a couple of seats (which they did within 5 mins). The facility is good but is overwhelmed by sheer numbers turning it into a below average experience. Departed flustered and irritated. Inbound arrived around midday and what a different experience. Lots of space with about 10% of seats occupied. Tried the restaurant which had both buffet and a la carte available - good food and good wine made for an excellent lunch. Shower facilities clean and pleasant with lots of amenities available. Try and pick your transit time! Scores reflect an average of the 2 experiences.,lounge
1612,Traveled through LHR-DOH-BKK and the same return. Outbound the lounge was very crowded with seats with two together hard to find. Disappointed with the lack of assistance from staff. This lounge is not a patch on its equivalent in LHR. Not a calm relaxing environment for a transfer.,lounge
1613,I found this lounge quite pleasant. PCs etc were quite slow but food service was excellent. Its a very small lounge so its not hard to have it quite full but we found quiet seats where the PCs were. Toilets immaculate lounge very clean staff great food good given we had a 11am flight to Sydney. Lounge could do with updating but given that Qantas don't have many flights out of Honolulu its suitable for the passengers.,lounge
1614,Lounge is very dated and showing its age with drab colour scheme and tired furnishings. However they have an excellent selection of food and wines. No French fizz but the Sallinger sparkling is very good. Highlight of my visit was the gelato bar. The staff at the desk and in the lounge were friendly. The wifi has finally been fixed.,lounge
1615,Lounge absolutely packed out this particular Wednesday morning. Food just average like a domestic Q Club breakfast so left the eating to that on the aircraft which was for a change far superior. Barista available for coffee which was good. Used PC whilst in lounge also a good selection of current magazines and newspapers to read. Toilets were very clean.,lounge
1616,Friendly staff who provided a service second to none. Choice of Krug or Bollinger Rose champagnes went down very well. Seafood platter was great with lobster and King prawns provided by in house chef Spent an extremely pleasant interlude prior to boarding after check in and official formalities Looking forward to next visit.,lounge
1617,Pleasant oasis for an extended layover. It was a little crowded at times with peak departures.,lounge
1618,A very impressive lounge. It is massive with loads of seating areas. There are dining areas lounging areas and snoozing areas. Selection of food and beverages is very good. Wide variety fresh and tasty. There is no reading material but WiFi is fast and free. The only let down is the bathroom facilities. 6 showers for several hundred passengers does not work very well.,lounge
1619,Adelaide Terminal is a MASSIVE improvement from the old one that I last flew into. The Qantas Club near Gate 23 is pretty much brand new very spacious very clean and well laid out. A lot of people were using it the food selection was very good the service by staff excellent and the toilets were outstanding. Very very pleasant indeed wish this were the case in the Qantas Club lounges in Sydney and Brisbane (they need updating badly). The only issue we had is that if your flight is in Gates below 16 then you have a significant walk to make the relevant gate so make allowance for this.,lounge
1620,Qantas has got it right when it comes to bringing kids into their lounges. In contrast with BA's policy of counting young children as guests Qantas takes a different position allowing a member to bring in one guest and their children.,lounge
1621,I found this lounge overcrowded hot dirty and a little run down. Bathrooms were dirty with some stalls inoperative. Staff were unfriendly and even sarcastic at times. This experience ruined my opinion of Qantas and my preference for flying with them.,lounge
1622,A joy - understated and elegant throughout and more like a hotel than a lounge. Though not the biggest there are areas for relaxing a cocktail bar a deli with bistro style dining area and a more formal brasserie. Attentive staff and the chicken satay I tried while sitting at the bar hit the spot.,lounge
1623,My wife and I had the experience of this lounge going to and from the Far East last month. Once you get to the Premium Terminal it is great. The only problem is until the new terminal is ready you have to ride around the airport for what seems an eternity on a bus. The lounge on the other hand was a welcome respite from all this. The personnel are friendly and extremely helpful. We found the same level of service both times we were there and each visit was about 12 hours different than the other. Plenty of seating great Wi-Fi fresh food and good drinks were all there in abundance. Qatar is a great airline and there Business Class lounge was a wonderful part of the total experience.,lounge
1624,This lounge is the only one in Male airport and it's ok but not great. The food looked as though it had been sitting around for ages and they had the air conditioner turned up a bit too high so it was very cold in the lounge. On the plus side they have nice comfortable seats clean bathrooms and a selection of magazines and newspapers to read. Certainly pales in comparison to the Premium Terminal in Doha.,lounge
1625,Dreadful lounge at Honolulu airport. Far removed from the immigration check points. Food selection really poor. As explained by staff the only hot selection was toast. Lounge is cramped and dated. The male staff member was outstanding in ensuring that passengers were attended too.,lounge
1626,The Qantas Club at Hobart Airport is now inside security thanks to a new corridor but is still by far the smallest of the capital city airports. On my last trip to Sydney I visited the lounge and there was just one seat left. Due to the limited space the chairs are also squashed much closer than other Qantas lounges. On a positive note the lounge offers good views of the runway and parked aircraft.,lounge
1627,Quite basic and dark decor very dated. Food uninspiring and basic but then it was a very late night departure (nearly midnight) so maybe the options were better earlier in the evening. Lots of monitors to ensure you don't miss your flights. The bathrooms were not great. Overall pretty average.,lounge
1628,This lounge was an absolute delight. It was immaculate bright comfortable and modern. The staff were attentive and the food was of a high quality. It was not busy when we were there and maybe this enhanced our experience and also of course it is brand new. We were travelling on holiday and this was a wonderful start to our first business class experience. The service on the plane kept up the 5-star service. We did a brief stop on our return at the Doha lounge and it was a disappointment after the hype we'd read nowhere near our Heathrow experience.,lounge
1629,Had a half-hour to spend in this lounge whilst journeying from Melbourne to London Heathrow. The staff look wonderful with the females in the maroon Qatar livery and the men in their sharp suits. The lounge looks impressive too. However when you cannot even find a vacant seat and a request to a member of staff for help is responded to with a dismissive wave of the arm. It is evident that they cannot cope with volume and the purpose of the patrolling staff is rather lost on me. I found it quite ironic that Qatar promotes this lounge as being superb yet for me it was the major disappointment in an otherwise excellent Qatar Airways experience.,lounge
1630,On the outward flight to Bangkok only a short transit time but coming back over 8 hours in Doha and there is no finer place to spend such a long transit time. The business class lounge was quite busy when I arrived so I thought I’ll find a seat visit the restaurant when the crowds were less - big mistake as I fell asleep and by the time I awoke they’d finished serving meals. Although you could get drinks I missed a very nice looking mutton dish. The lounge was almost empty during the night and only began to fill up again early the following morning when more flights stared to arrive. The service from the staff was wonderful - somebody walking around checking you were okay. I’d only been awake a few minutes before a young lady arrived with a blanket. Qatar use the Escape Lounge at Manchester and one of the Thai lounges in Bangkok but nothing can compare to the premium terminal in Doha.,lounge
1631,Quite a nice lounge with a good choice of food and drink available. Wifi available must ask reception for the password. Very clean showers and toilets. Staff service very good. Good selection of Australian newspapers/magazines available. Very close to the Qantas boarding gates in the G Concourse of Bangkok International.,lounge
1632,Large and clean lounge. Excellent food and beverage selection. Clean and tidy showers and bathroom facilities. Overlooks the airport so you can look out the widow and see planes! Staff were pleasant on checking in however the staff working in the lounge didn't really engage in chat or smile as you passed by. They were just concentrating on doing whatever they were doing. A fabulous calm place to wait instead of with the screaming masses of kids and excited travellers.,lounge
1633,As always a pleasant experience to go to the new Qatar Airways Lounge in Terminal 4. I tried the sit down dinner service the food was tasty and plentiful and the service great.,lounge
1634,Very fine lounge. Good food. As others mentioned no alcohol is available during Ramadan which seems unfortunate if inevitable. Very comfortable and soothing space - flight announcements aren't made but plenty of screens showing times and staff will also notify you. Showers along with razors and toothbrush are available in the bathroom. The one real shame is that there are not really any spaces to lie down and most people are traveling after pretty long haul flights often at odd hours. But none of this detracts from the excellence of the lounge. A real highlight is the quality of the service. Staff are excellent and seemingly eager to help - the contrast with say United Airlines could not have been more stark. The check-in to both the lounge and the airline is made as simple as possible. A real plus when flying Qatar Airways.,lounge
1635,During Ramadan it is totally empty no alcohol is served at all. Other standards are excellent but not everyone who travels with Qatar Airways is Islamic.,lounge
1636,Excellent lounge - very warm atmosphere. The showers were spotless. The food was excellent and there was a very good range of both cold and hot food available even at the late hour of 10 p.m. Lovely Minestrone soup - piping hot. A very relaxing place - wish all lounges were this nice.,lounge
1637,Very well lit spacious areas and ample comfortable seating. Wide choice of beverages and snacks. The Restaurant Dining looked good ( though did not try ). Same for the Spa. Nice working areas with sufficient iMacs. In the early morning busy hour the lounge still had enough seating. Courteous staff.,lounge
1638,A quiet Business lounge located at the Brisbane International whilst waiting for our Hong Kong flight. Lounge is comfortable plenty of seating good coffee available selection of food is not so good very ordinary in fact could do with a revamp. Alcohol available even with a mid morning flight out. Good selection of local papers and magazines available to read as well as free wifi and internet. Overall a serviceable international business class lounge that could do with some fine tuning that would make it a wonderful start to one's departure.,lounge
1639,Well appointed large area courteous staff but a few more signs would help. Travelling during Ramadan is a problem if your stopover is for any length of time and you're used to an evening drink. As alcohol was served on both legs of the flight we were surprised that it was not available under any circumstances in the lounge - we would have been happy to have been quarantined into non-Muslim section of the lounge or similar - to while away the time between 7 and 12 pm. I'm always happy to respect other cultures but it was the confusing messages that got to me and the lack of information about their services when booking.,lounge
1640,Fantastic new lounge at LHR. Arrived from an 11 o'clock flight and promptly served breakfast from the buffet. The cook showed great knowledge of the food and ingredients served and staff responded promptly to requests. Seating area was spacious with choice of window seating central relaxing area with water fountain or TV corner. Very pro-active staff tending to customers needs through out the stay.,lounge
1641,Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. Newly built (open for about 4 months at the time) large and boasting high-end features such as bedrooms along with high-end features one can expect to find in a flagship lounge. We had a long transfer at AMM (originally scheduled for 12 hours which ended out being 19 hours due to RJ technical problems) so were looking forward to a good lounge to make the wait less taxing. The first glitch occurred when staff at the counter attempted to deny us entry to the lounge saying that we should only come to the lounge 2-3hrs before our flight. When we pointed out to them the complete absurdity of this request given that we were on transit between two RJ flights and that this goes against the Oneworld regulations the matter was settled. However this was a poor welcome if we ever saw one. The so called bedrooms are a paid service at $50 for the first four hours then $20 per hour. Fair enough though a bit pricey for a long stay (and a bit cheeky to price the first segment at 4 hours when they try to deny entry only 2 hours before the flight). We had a look at a room which included a double bed shower and a cupboard (some 25 sqm I would say). We went to confirm that we wanted the room (was traveling with my wife pregnant of 6 months at the time) and were told that the rooms are considered single rooms and under no circumstances can be let out to more than one person. Again I stress that the room clearly had a double bed but we failed to get anywhere with this and were told that this is a clear order from “senior RJ management”. Why RJ went to the trouble of building and designing such rooms is questionable given this policy but at least this should be clearly flagged on their website when they talk of this so that other couples do not plan to book this service and make alternative arrangements. The lounge offers quiet rooms with some 6-7 armchairs in a relatively dark and quiet area adjacent to the bedrooms. However we found these very uncomfortable to attempt to sleep on and ended up leaving the lounge to a nearby hotel to get some sleep. In the morning there was a nice yet modest buffet (cold items only). In the evening there were three hot dishes. None too appealing but ok to snack if hungry. A separate staffed bar in a separate corner with less options that one finds in most other large lounges but large enough to cover basic requests. Infrastructure impressive and clearly RJ invested a lot in creating the lounge. However it is a bad sign that only 4 months after opening there are already issues with core features. For example there are some 12 individual sofas with personalized TV screens and high-end headsets. When we tried to use them we found the volume level unbearably loud. We tried another station. Same thing. When we asked the RJ staff we were told that all the TVs were like this and there is nothing to be done except to hold the headsets some 50cm away from the ears. Personally I find this pathetic and a miserable design/execution of a key feature of a lounge. I could go on but I think the message is clear - Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. My gut feeling is that with time as the new furniture and excitement wears down this will rapidly become a B-rated lounge at best.,lounge
1642,By presenting my One World Sapphire card I was given access to this lounge and the staff on reception very friendly. The lounge was too small for the amount of people present. At either end of the lounge were televisions although it was very difficult to hear them over the noise of the people. The smoking section wasn't screened off and I could hear people complaining about the smoke in the non smoking areas. Drink in plentiful supply including alcoholic juices tea etc and snacks were available although these were mainly cakes dates etc. It was surprising that even though there were so many people the lounge was tidy and plates and cups were cleared often. The staff clearing the plates were friendly but the staff behind the bar area didn't seem as friendly but they certainly weren't rude. It was certainly a retreat from the main terminal and as you get refreshments for 'free' to be honest even though it was very full I cannot complain and I did enjoy being there.,lounge
1643,It is an okay lounge. Has very slow internet but awesome catering. It offers drinks and snacks and overall it is impressive. It can get very busy though right before the flights to Australia.,lounge
1644,Food generally of good quality. Food choices not always great (I might be a bit picky) - usually worse when changing over from breakfast to lunch etc. Drink choice excellent. Even when it's busy there's always somewhere to sit. Good view of planes and the city. Computers are great and wifi readily available. One of the selling points when travelling Qantas.,lounge
1645,Pleasant greeting and offered lunch on entering lounge. Very clean and comfortable with frequent offers of snacks - which were delicious. Bathrooms very well appointed and clean. Called for flight at the right time with staff lining up to say goodbye. A thoroughly pleasant experience in a comfortable and well run Lounge.,lounge
1646,On arrival into Doha the lounge was jam packed (about 8am) though we did manage to find a seat. Nonetheless the food and drinks were tasty and in plentiful supply. The bathrooms were clean and virtually empty. On our return journey (about 11pm) the lounge was much less busy and so we were able to spread out a bit more. It's a nice place to while away an hour or two.,lounge
1647,The lounge is in line with being a 5-Star airline. Good food good drink selection comfy polite friendly staff.. I would route through Doha anytime.,lounge
1648,Super lounge with maximum comfort. The staff is very attentive to your needs. The only small critique would be that the duty free area is somewhat reduced for products.,lounge
1649,The entry is calming and refreshing spaciousness captivating. A La Carte dining sublime for my wife and me the best was the PAYOT Spa. There really is only one problem with this lounge. It has set the standard so high other lounges we experienced were poor in comparison.,lounge
1650,No wonder no one uses the facility as there is nothing here - almost nothing to eat poor selection of drinks no restaurants. Qantas you are not the first class airline.,lounge
1651,Qatar Airways Business class passengers or Privilege Club gold Members may use the Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at Frankfurt airport. A medium size lounge sufficient choice of hot and cold foods generous choice of wines beers soft drinks. Wifi has to be paid for. Large choice of newspaper and magazines in different languages TV screens. I found staff in this lounge to be helpful and attentive.,lounge
1652,Qatar Airways use the Coral Executive lounge for their frequent flyers / business class passengers. A medium size lounge comfortable with a relaxing atmosphere. Beach view fax telephone wifi newspapers. No toilets in the lounge but outside on departure hall. Good choice of hot and cold food and drinks - although there seem to be no wines (beers available). Meet and greet service you are zipped through immigration fast track to the lounge. Excellent staff welcoming and polite.,lounge
1653,Business Terminal is a must. Transfer from the aircraft to terminal is smooth and fast Lounge is huge and cosy with a good selection of food and beverages. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Wireless internet access easy but a bit slow. Lavatories are not up to this kind of lounge standards.,lounge
1654,Great restaurant service and food. Spa service fantastic. I had facial this time. Plenty of drinks and fruit available. Internet service good computers available as well. Private office is good for some last minute work.,lounge
1655,The One world lounge in LAX is as bad as the rest of the airport the First lounge bit gets so cramped before the night time international flights go out that they have to ask passengers via the speaker system to keep all seats free from bags etc so that everyone gets a seat- being cramped into a lounge area with several complete strangers is not my idea of First! Entire feel is shocking and while they have quite nice food options and Champagne the service buffet maintenance etc are not up to scratch during busy periods.,lounge
1656,Small and confusing opening times especially when flights are delayed. The lounge closes you get asked to leave and then can re-enter once it opens later in the morning. Comfortable enough with usual food and drinks. No coffee barista. Wifi works and cold drinks are cold.,lounge
1657,The bus from the plane takes you directly to the Premium Terminal which has a wide atrium and divided into the business class section and first class section. The lounge was very spacious but crowded and busy on a Sunday morning. Had enough time to check out the food which has limited options on the lounge side but a full restaurant on the other. Quite impressive. Only downside was the busy washrooms. Shower facilities available. Adequate announcements were made for boarding and the boarding process was very smooth and efficient. Would fly through Doha again.,lounge
1658,The Premium Lounge has always been a great experience - you almost want a delay. In the past year the business class side has doubled in size which it needed. I spent 13 hours in the lounge in 8 days (no delays just long transfers) and I give it 100%.,lounge
1659,A big difference noticed now that the business class section has expanded as it got very crowded close to midnight when lots of flights leave after this time. Separate set of toilets are in the news section also so this helps relieve the overcrowded toilets problem. Food is average as are the selection of drinks and not much choice for snacks either. Internet seems to be extremely slow each time I have tried to use it and given up.,lounge
1660,Used the lounge in the morning for an international flight to Kuala Lumpur. Large and spacious but somewhat dark. Adequate terminals and wi-fi was available. There was no hot food on offer in the morning just a selection of cereals fruit and yoghurt. A fried or boiled egg would have been nice. The coffee was very good as were the fruit juices on offer. Toilets were clean and well appointed with showers for use. Overall a nice experience but it would have been nice if they had a hot buffet for breakfast.,lounge
1661,Used the lounge when travelling British Airways F-class from HKG to LHR. Facilities are fair but not really up to many airlines First Class levels. The prospect of trying to snatch a meal/dinner before the flight was very limited and aside from some snack type foods or soup there was nothing. Staff at reception polite and friendly but no other service really offered in the lounge aside from cleaning staff. Shower facilities are at the basic end of the quality scale and very mean in terms of the amenities they offer. Not a patch on other Qantas lounges in Australia and clearly BA tries (yet again) to save by using this lounge for their customers (not even any BA branding visible.,lounge
1662,The dedicated premium lounge at Doha is large comfortable and well appointed. Food okay nothing special. Drink choices are excellent. The men's wash room only has 4 toilets and 3 showers. If your transit time is short like mine (1-2 hours) and you find the lounge is busy these facilities can become overwhelmed. So best to visit these facilities first before settling down. Qatar really need to address this issue soon.,lounge
1663,Lounge is spacious and ample seating. The food selection while not varied was abundant for the lounge. Shower amenities excellent however a bit concerning to see mould growing on the tiled walls. Catering staff asked if she could make sandwiches for me - a nice touch. Drinks ample. There is not much of a view from this lounge but not a problem for short stay. Internet wifi super.,lounge
1664,Lots of free PC's and different types of seating. Busy but some seating. Really good range of drinks and snacks- no sandwiches but lots of hot food and salad if wanted. Very clean and lots of staff. Impressive.,lounge
1665,Qantas has hired room 5 above gate 21 which is a fairly large area. Lounge had a good feel to it with plenty of food and drinks available. Staff good and children rooms and business computers plentiful. Only gripe would be the lack of toilets. Toilets were huge one toilet rooms and the lounge only had two per gender. Seeing as this route has only been operating the last 2 months this lounge is more than adequate for the one Qantas flight,lounge
1666,Premium Terminal is a bit confusing to get to as the bus operator from the plane makes no announcements. Once in the terminal there is a limited duty free shopping area (much smaller than the main terminal's) and a few gates. Upstairs is the lounge area for premium passengers. Service is good as you are greeted immediately upon arrival. From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge. The business class lounge has a large dining area with actual table service. Food selection was excellent for a lounge - with actual main dishes and an endless variety of premium drinks. Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd. Overall a very comfortable lounge but not much to do in the terminal for long stopovers.,lounge
1667,Still a great lounge although staff service seems to have fallen away in recent months. Buffet food has improved a bit from late last year but what makes me so mad is the poor internet / wifi service. Complained to lounge staff and they just shrug and say it is working fine!?,lounge
1668,A pleasant lounge with showers and willing staff. Fine selection of food - wines not a great standard. Plenty of seating and computer positions. Sadly no view. Shared with BA - but few UK newspapers.,lounge
1669,Nice atmosphere comfortable lounges  great wifi stunning bathrooms but food choice very poor and no view or outlook.,lounge
1670,An exceptionally good a la carte food service provided and staff are very pleasant. Excellent computer facilities. Very modern and clean shower rooms with high quality amenities. The lounge also has a very good spa and massage area. Without question a better first-class lounge than any others that I have used.,lounge
1671,"Had a long transit with redeemed mileage ticket Bangkok to Manchester. As frequent flyer - Gold - able to use the Gold lounge at Doha. Small but very quiet throughout- marble shower and extremely helpful staff. Seating limited to quite upright lounge chairs. A good selection of food almost 24 hours. One negative comment the ""quiet room"" in the main terminal is anything but with constant tannoy announcements.",lounge
1672,Nice spacious lounge. Escorted from aircraft in BMW 7 series quick walk through security and into lounge. Enjoyed nice cooked breakfast fresh fruits etc - staff very friendly and efficient. Had a 4 hour stopover and managed to bag a bedroom where had a few hours rest before using shower room to freshen up. Good selection of mags/newspapers. WiFi was a little slow but internet terminals also in lounge were quick. Much more like a hotel than an airline lounge. Well done Qatar!,lounge
1673,Upon arrival you are directed to the First or Business lounge as appropriate and we experienced both (there being no first class seats available on our return journey). First lounge is an absolute haven - great selection of food and beverages comfy chairs and sofas sleep cabins if required spa and also a smoking room for those who require it. Good internet access although only a limited number of fixed terminals available - Wi-fi is free throughout though. Business lounge is similar to first but lacking in the sleep cabins and naturally much more crowded than First lounge. In both lounges staff are friendly and helpful and come around to announce your flight personally. Feeling a bit off-colour and in need of some antacid the staff directed me to the clinic where I was soon fixed up and got the feeling that they would have attended to pretty much any condition from which I was suffering. I think this is a great idea that should be widely copied. If you travel business class do be aware that the bus takes you to the regular terminal first so make sure you stay on board until you reach the premium terminal. This is no issue if you arrive first class as you are whisked from the plane in a 7-series BMW straight to the premium terminal.,lounge
1674,I use this lounge a few times a year. Every time it is very crowded and thus noisy. Hardly a place to unwind before a flight or between connecting flights. In fact it is one of the most crowded lounges I use anywhere in the world.,lounge
1675,Great breakfast options. Free wifi. Lots of reading material and seating options. Great decor. Only gripe was the espresso coffee machine wasn't staffed until I was boarding at 0800. The machine coffee was okay so I survived!,lounge
1676,Best lounge I've been in. Staff so attentive without hovering. Spa treatments are first rate. Food in restaurant is cooked to order. A very pleasant experience and made a 6 hour transfer very tolerable.,lounge
1677,Transfer to the Premium terminal via Business class bus still confusing for first time users as the bus stops at the arrivals terminal and passengers are not informed they need to stay on the bus as 1 found out the hard way. New security measures in force on arrival into the Premium terminal - on clearing directed to First Class lounge. show to seats and refreshments offered immediately. Excellent service by pleasant staff. Area constantly cleaned nice to see clean tables not littered by previous guests drinks etc. Selection of both hot and cold food available. Able to take shower and shave in excellent shower room with quality amenities and excellent staff. Invited to board in a timely manner. Overall one of the best lounges visited.,lounge
1678,We had a four hour transit at Doha the cost was £14.00 each and certainly good value for money. The seating facility was spacious spotless and very pleasant to rest in. The food and beverage area was immaculate a good variety of snacks with hot and cold beverages being topped up all of the time even though there was no alcohol (Ramadan period). Towels were available for showers and the staff were all excellent and we would certainly use this lounge again,lounge
1679,Used business lounge in Qatar's new premium terminal in transit between London and Singapore and return. First point - coach from plane drops people at normal (old) terminal first - I thought there would be a separate coach for business class - we nearly got off at the wrong terminal as the information given is not that clear. New terminal is very impressive visually and well maintained. Reading material limited (on way back through early in the morning there wasn't any at all.) Would prefer a self service bar for wine/beers etc - there was a somewhat limited range of wines in the fridges available and no menus/drinks lists. Didn't look for or use PC so can't comment on Internet access. No announcements made staff wander round giving flight information and you can be sat some way away from screens giving flight info. Staff friendly enough but didn't volunteer any assistance. Given limited time available didn't have time to eat but there seemed to be a good variety of hot food available. Overall a very nice lounge but with a few minor improvements could be even better.,lounge
1680,"Lufthansa lounge at LHR T2. Large windows look out onto runways and taxiways with lots of activity. The lounge is spacious and airy, subdivided by freestanding furniture. So although the room is large, the ambiance is cosy and quiet. Various newspapers and magazines were available. The seating is mainly leather armchairs separated by table units. A dining area is equipped with dining tables and chairs, in front of a well stocked bar and food buffet. As a nice touch there was a big jug of ready made Pimms (with lots of fruit garnish) available as a celebration of Wimbledon. In the morning the food on offer was bacon, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, plenty of breads, cold meats and various garnishes. At about 11am this changed to hot lunch items: rice, chicken casserole, pasta with sauce, soup and various other items. The staff were very unobtrusive and kept the place clean and tidy. WiFi was easy to use. As this is located in the new Queen's Terminal 2 everything is brand new.",lounge
1681,A quiet comfortable lounge poor view outside. Food and beverages plentiful and good. I was doing some work with a colleague while waiting for our flight and found the wi-fi a bit slow but connection was easy and stable. Friendly staff who circulated constantly to keep the place clean.,lounge
1682,Stunning lounge. Food excellent surroundings tranquil and very comfortable. The lounge features a wall of green live plants. Washrooms and showers spotless and amenities were first class. Dining was excellent panoramic view of aprons.,lounge
1683,Pretty decent lounge with reasonable airside view. Food selection is limited and expected more in an international lounge. Fairly spacious. Fast internet access. Overall 3-Star standard.,lounge
1684,Excellent atmosphere coupled with perfect service. If only airport lounges be this way. Service is friendly and confident they seems like well trained and genuine hospitable staff who cares. Attention to details is remarkable the flowers plats music and candles etc. Beverage service is excellent; my champagne came with few strawberries. Selection of food is somewhat limited but well presented with care. Spa is the best bit and after my 7 hours journey I had massage which was unbelievably good.,lounge
1685,"The lounge consists of two lounges with the same entrance the Scandinavian Lounge on the 4th floor and the Business Lounge on the 3rd. I believe EuroBonus Silver card holders can access the Business Lounge during Summer time and from mid-december until mid-January and it is thus more crowded than the Scandinavian Lounge. The food selection is ok nothing extraordinary. The beverage selection is quite disappointing (one red wine one white wine one beer). The space is rather nice in classic ""Danish"" design. The best lounge in CPH.",lounge
1686,SAS is one of my favorite airlines but please do something about the Stockholm lounge. The offering of food and drinks compared to Copenhagen and Helsinki are incredibly poor and gives the wrong impression of Swedish service and cuisine to visitors.,lounge
1687,Nice lounge nice ikea style decor. View of one of the gates at terminal 5 ample seating. Got in due to star alliance gold status (United). Nice spread of snacks much better than the swissport lounge in terminal 5. Roomy enough seating. Staff pleasant and helpful. Food ok compared to a lounge in the US.,lounge
1688,Service was excellent. I had a long wait and after a very relaxing massage and shower I was tired. A member of staff spoke to me when I stirred just to check what flight I was on so he could wake me if I appeared to be sleeping through the flight boarding call. Could improve the amenities in the showers however for a first class lounge you expect female amenities rather than the more general ones.,lounge
1689,As per previous comments - a small lounge which comfortably accommodates a full business/star class cabin and QF Club members. Not a lot is provided in the way of television entertainment however food and beverages are well stocked. Staff are very friendly and only too willing to help. Wi-Fi is confusing: as this lounge is shared with American Airlines it uses their pay- per-use wi-fi. This service is provided free to QF passengers. Talk to the desk staff who will provide you with details of how to log-in. This lounge certainly beats the cramped and uncomfortable departure lounges in HNL airport.,lounge
1690,Qantas Club at HNL is quite small but run by friendly staff who are available for assistance. The food and beverage areas are small but well stocked. I was there for a morning flight and was happy with the pastries cereal and fruits on offers.,lounge
1691,The lounge itself is nice but hard to find. Visited between 08.20-09.40. Food selection was a bowl of oatmeal som vegetables chips and dip. You cold also choose between apple and orange juice different kind of (coca cola brand) sodas beer or vine. The lounge is self serviced.,lounge
1692,Unacceptable Internet (WiFi) access - Connection is disconnected several times during all my last stays the last 2 years at this Lounge. My colleagues had always the same problem. In no other lounge we had so much problems with internet access. Temperature especially during the summer months is way too high this is very inconvenient. After complaining several times at the front desk nothing happens even no explanation why this problem cannot be fixed. This is really unprofessional.,lounge
1693,Disappointed with this lounge in CPH. The lounge is features a modern design. Food selection is ok and food is quite tasty. Drinks selection very poor no wifi (staff informed me that wifi had not been working for over a month) and lounge very crowded.,lounge
1694,Staff although helpful appeared to think keeping things clean was beneath them. The cleanliness of the place needed to be stepped up a notch for me. Quality of the food was average the fact they shut the coffee bar was completely odd. I was told to use a cheap vending machine? Range of wines and other beverages generally good.,lounge
1695,A really small and uninviting lounge compared to the normal QF fare. Incredibly quiet - everyone was whispering! No TV internet. Almost no food (packets of chips only for most of my stay then a few sandwiches) and no staff noticed when the wine ran out. Why not use the BA lounge instead?,lounge
1696,A clean and tidy lounge - although by the time all eligible passengers are in the lounge it can be quite cramped and busy. It is operated by two staff who work hard when the lounge is full as it serves both JQ and QF flights including QC members traveling on JetStar economy. I recommend arriving early as access can be denied when the lounge hits peak capacity. There can be a lengthy queue to enter at times as there is only one person manning the reception desk and she must record your details manually as you enter. Food and beverage amenities are adequate. There is no television but there are 3 PC terminals. WiFi coverage is a bit confusing as most pax needing access needed staff assistance to log in. Overall a good lounge and an alternative to the bus shelter that is HNL terminal.,lounge
1697,I visited this lounge on March 5 between 05:45-06:20. The lounge can often be crowded but not at this early morning occasion. The breakfast offered was very good and tasteful including plenty of selections. The offerings regarding breakfast has however not been changed for a long time. It would be nice with some kind of variation even if the overall concept is very good. The lounge needs some upgrades since especially the (rather cosy) sofas and armchairs starts to get relatively worn and threadbare. The Internet access is easy and fast and I have never experienced any problem top class. The variety of newspapers and magazines are good. The staff are nice and service minded and keep the tables clean and tidy.,lounge
1698,I visited SAS Business Lounge available for travellers in SAS Plus at STockholm Arlanda Airport. The interior of the lounge is ok but nothing special. The assortment of food and drinks are very poor. The lounge was also quite crowded.,lounge
1699,The lounge is quiet and clean with a good selection of beverages. However when it comes to getting some food to fill you up (high in protein) there is not many options. The food served is generally healthy but it's lacking protein sources like fish chicken meat and so on. In this regard lounges at VIE FRA are better options.,lounge
0,"Fantastic spot for an even or a quite cocktail.  They were swell to host the Yelp crew with a great drink menu and super attentive staff.I'd certainly recommend anything with the purred fruit in it (apple, any of them really)!

1,"Love, love, love the calamari. It's so good and spicy. There is an endless list of martinis and one is better than the next. There is a first and second floor, if you prefer more of a bar or lounge atmosphere. It's not a place I like for dinner, but for drinks and apps it's wonderful.
",others
2,"Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day.
",others
3,"It's everything a great cocktail bar should be.  Great location, ambiance, cocktails and chill environment.**Disclaimer:   5 stars doesn't have to mean it's New York City good. It is a simple place and it's not flashy by any means.   I'd take a girl for the beginning of a date or on the opposite end of the spectrum, talking business with colleagues.

4,"I came here before a pirates game, so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening, we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open before all there reservations for the night started to come in.  I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely loved it!  The chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was off set with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good!  The salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce.  I also loved that they put feta cheese on top, its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping!  Service was great here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy!  Love this place and can't wait for my next visit!

5,"Olive or Twist is the historic site of my VERY FIRST MARTINI when I turned 21, many years ago.  It's been a long, happy union.While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me because I love it.  Its one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTANTLY good.  for years!  The interior is warm and a little bit industrial.  The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice.The drinks are great although the first martini I ever had (a girl doesn't forget!  [well,this one didn't]) was a Pineapple Upside Down martini and I don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu.  I tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent that when I took my first sip I sighed in a way my bf turned to me and sarcastically said, ""Oh, you're going to be Yelping about that, aren't you""  Then, I refused to let him even try it bc it was that good.  It was MINE.I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less.  Whatever. She needs a martini.The service was great.  Our waitress, Lauren, was really cool and very good at recommending the drinks--the chipotle martini was her recommendation, I would never had ordered that on my own.We had the buffalo chicken dip which was served in a martini glass and it was really good.My favorite thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years.  It's delicious.  Its so good that Lauren and I actually high fived when she brought it out.  (true story.)My bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent, it was gone within minutes so that is a good sign.I highly recommend this place for lunch, after dinner cocktails, or a date.  This is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots!

8,"The location is in a strip mall, but this place is a diamond in the rough.  The food was some of the best italian food I have had anywhere.  I live in Kansas City, which has a pretty large and long standing italian populaiton.  The food is a good as any of the old italian places in KC.  Everyone in my group was amazed at the quality of the food for the price.  I will keep this one on my list of places to come back to when I am in AZ again.

10,"We can't say enough good things about this place. The owner and wait staff were genuinely friendly and the food was great. I had the veal caprese and my wife had the canolone.  Both were exceptional and reasonably priced.  Unlike the chain Italian restaurants, the portions were reasonable instead of super-sized.  We were full but not stuffed when we finished.  We also brought our fourteen month old along.  They don't have a kids menu, so I can't call the restaurant ""family friendly,"" but everyone was really friendly to our family. The owner even stopped by once or twice to pinch our son's cheeks.  We live near by and are considering becoming regulars here.

11,"My husband and I want to give six stars!!!!  We've driven by this place for a year, and always talked about going in....SO sorry we waited so long!!!  Very pretty little place.  The service was great and very warm.  I had the butternut squash ravioli and in was in heaven for every single bite!!!  We will be back often and plan to take my daughter next time.  I don't think they have a kid's menu, but our server said they could do spaghetti and meatballs or fettucine with chicken.  Perfect.  Thank you Jennifer!!!  We loved it!!!  =)

12,"I'm still laughing reading poor Maribeth's review below; I think maybe her ex DID pay someone to play an awful joke on her.  Like drugging her and taking her to Wendy's and telling her she was at Salute.  This place is the best little neighborhood secret ever and I only hope everyone reads and believes Maribeth's review so I can still get a table on Friday nights without making a reservation.
",others
13,"My husband and I have been here several times, both for large functions and on our own.  What we always notice is how attentive the wait staff is.  And they really seem to care about our dining experience.  Of the appetizers, we love the antipasto, stuff mushrooms and seafood salad.  The butternut squash ravioli is awesome, as is everything we've tried.  The strip mall location isn't particularly appealing, but the good food and excellent service will keep us coming back.
",others
14,"Very, very good. Top notch calamari and scampi appetizers. Excellent garlic bread.Entrees were eggplant parm- great; lasagna- excellent; orange roughy with capers and artichokes-amazing and cheese tortellini with 4 cheese sauce- also great.Perfect service- a really on the ball waiter. Close to Hilton Tapatio  Cliffs too.Cozy place, nicely lit made you forget about the strip mall locale.

15,"Saturday night at Salutes is a real treat.  The live jazz duo sings quietly and adds to the ambience of this local gem.  The staff is always friendly and makes some reference to your last trip which makes you feel special.  And speaking of special...their chicken florentine special was mouth-watering.  I'm sure the bottle of Chianti helped...but just LOVED the experience.
",others
16,"Went with family last night...loved it! Our server, Julie, was excellent- extremely friendly and attentive to our table. The stuffed mushroom and shrimp scampi appetizers were delicious...excellent for dipping the really good garlic bread in the sauces. :) My daughter said that the fettuccine alfredo (not on the menu, but offered) was the best she's ever tasted. The butternut squash ravioli was very rich (almost too rich) but quite tasty. The guys both got the crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli with walnut cream sauce (not on the regular menu)- both loved it!  It's a really great place for a special date or a quaint dinner with friends.
",others
17,"I've been waiting to change from four stars to five and tonights dining experience did it.  The staff always makes us feel like one of their family and tonight was no different.

BTW...the place was packed...you may need a reservation!

20,"Irene's was my favorite spot to drink whilst on vacation. We ordered a pizza and I don't remember what my bf ordered, a burger, I think Our pizza was really good. I think it had jalepenos and sausage. And maybe extra cheese It was like $7. Had two drinks while we sat and enjoyed the company. The bartender was so sweet and friendly. They have a daily contest where you can win cash money if you come a few days a month and gamble there. It wouldn't work if you don't live there so I tuned out on the details. I don't know why we even bother with the strip. Get off the strip, people. See the real Vegas. Leftovers were yummy the next morning, cold or warmed. It's a dive but a good one.
",others
21,"When I lived in Vegas I was right behind the place. I was coming home from a mid week bender in the strip. Didn't feel like going home and I was all jacked up on vodkared bull and hungry. I stopped in here cuz I hadn't checked it out. Met someone right away from the Chicago burbs. Bartender was a cool guy. Had a pizza and I'm from Chicago so I'm a pizza snob. I was kinda drunk but that fawker tasted great. Had a beer or two then stumbled home and passed out.

22,"I take clients to clubs for lunch when I am in Charlotte on business. I travel all over and was not expecting much in Charlotte. I had gone to one uptown club a few times and it was nice.  I went to a Friday lunch special at The Men's Club from a hotel referral. It is remarkably nice inside, good staff, good music and a better menu than the hotel I was staying in. It was something I would have expected in Las Vegas, not Charlotte. I will go back every time I am in town.
",others
23,"This is by far the best strip club in Charlotte. I come here on Wednesdays for the lunch buffet during the day which is always a steal for 10$ all you can eat plus admission into the club. Otherwise I usually come on Friday or Saturday night when its packed with girls. The seating is comfortable and 1 large stage and three mini side stages. Girls are friendly and most are above a 7. Dances are 20$ and worth every penny. My favorite there is Bianca who is amazing in VIP.
",others
24,"Love the place, very friendly staff and definitely the hottest girls in town. Nonpushy girls which is a big plus. Very classy and clean, definitely not your typical strip club. The food is very good and reasonably priced. Check it out, you won't be sorry!!
",others
25,"Not only does this club have gorgeous entertainers, on point service from bartenders and waitresses, and an upscale environment, but the food is absolutely AMAZING!  They just added a ton of new items to their menu.  I highly recommended the Bison Cheddar Meatloaf and the Bone in Pork Chop topped with crawfish.  They have some great specialty cocktails with catchy names like the Wet Panty and Carmel Apple Tittay.This is not your typical strip club.  Everyone here is very polite (you won't get hounded for a dance the second you sit down).  The environment is very nice, classy, and CLEAN.  Their VIP area upstairs is top notch and always a great time.  Make sure to check out the bar at the top of the stairs, which IS open to the public.  The view from upstairs is awesome because you can see the whole club.Their breakfast buffet is also a great end to a Friday or Saturday night, so check it out 2am to 3:30am on those days.

30,"INDOOR SMOKING (when I'm looking for it) IS TOTALLY AWESOME!We came in here one night after an already long night of drinking.  The place was quiet, but the bar was incredibly well stocked, they allowed indoor smoking, and sold a range of cigars.  What's not to love, rightWe closed the place down... at some point, we ordered a delivery pizza.  The bartender was a ton of fun, told great stories, fed the jukebox with great songs (and let us pick about half of them) and really kept us going.  The prices were really reasonable on drinks, and we all had (too much of) a good time.  Several TVs had football on (without sound) and the bathroom was extremely clean.  Really, what more do you need in a barIf I had to critique one thing, though, it would be the cigar brands.  I think I only noticed one or two, but none of them were names I recognized.

32,"They hired a new bartender. It was his first night on Sat. If I remember correctly I think his name is David. Gosh, I'm probably totally wrong though.Anyway, he's tended at a couple different places. He made 1 damn good Jamaican 10 Speed. I dislike Malibu so I asked for Parrot Bay. Delicious. I hope he sticks around for a while.There was a late last call on Sat too. They were still serving right up till 2. They pretty much called last call at 1:50. So I think we got out of there around 2:15.Oh, & I finally spotted the juke box. I've walked right past it quite a few times. I think when I look around for the juke box I picture the ones from the 50-70's or so. I'm looking for big, tall, brightly lit, & maybe orange or yellow colored. I'm so spastic sometimes lolRestroom light was on again too :)Come any day of the week. It's always fun here.

34,"Very cool divey casinobar with some of the friendliest people in vegas working there.  Been coming here for years and I never get tired of it.  You get mardi gras beads as you walk in and immediately after someone is there to get you a drink.  A couple of minutes later you are gaming, drinking and having a great time, and occasionally you really do win money and I mean real money, no tickets here so don't put a hundred in and then try to cash out, you'll be so loaded down with nickels and quarters you won't be able to walk.The drinks are strong, the slots are decently loose and the manager Barbara and the cashier Mary Ellen are so cool, make you feel so welcome.  The Russian cocktail waitress is really nice too and trust me, she'll be back to check on your drink before you can sip down the one you have.This is one thing I miss about Vegas, the free drinks to keep you there.  Most places don't give them away unless you're at a $1 machine and even then not usually.  So, La Bayou has my business two times a year, every year.  Keep up the good work everyone at La Bayou!

36,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because I've got a long story behind it.  To make it short, the yard long frozen drinks with the extra shot for a dollar caused me to get married on the fly. And actually the second one I had a WELL-POURED extra shot of Bacardi 151, almost filled up the entire bowl in the bottom of the yard long!!  The county almost wouldn't give us a marriage license!!  But that was nearly 7 years ago, and eveyrthing has worked out really well.  I do remember the place being very fun and crazy for a ""shotgun"" dive casino.  We'll go back next time we're in Vegas, not only for the memories, but alos because it was just plain fun here.
",others
37,"We absolutely love this place! This has become our ""meetup"" spot downtown. It's a fun little dive. They give out beads and have raffles. They sell cool beads in the back and make awesome HUGE drinks in yards and footballs. They also have some old slots that you can't find very often, and the slots are fairly loose. We always win a bit of cash there. A small downside is that the slots are old school without tickets. They drop a ton of nickels if you win. It's minor though and actually kind of fun.It's not fancy, it's just fun! Go!!!

40,"FANTASTIC. Does not pretend to be anything more than what it is. The back bar is where its at, huge strong drink for 16 dollars, with a shot of ever clear for an extra 3. Worked like a charm. And they pay in coins! Brilliant

41,"We came to town on Valentine's Day to celebrate my youngest son's 21st b-day (yes, it's on V-Day).  Sadly, the drive from L.A. was more hellish than usual and we got to our condo so late that we skipped out on driving to Fremont.  (however, we did find Ellis Island nearby and enjoyed that for what it is! see my review)I really wanted to make sure my sons went down to Fremont where I knew we'd end up in Bayou so we came Sunday after breakfast (Omelette House- divine!) .  I've been here before (of course, back in 2001 I think the daiquiris were about 13 the price!).  I really don't enjoy gambling, but I do like to sit at a REAL coin-op slot machine and pull the arm of the one-armed bandit with my own hand.  There is something very satisfying about plunking coins in and hearing your winnings clink into the tray.  A classic Vegas experience that is hard to come-by today. I truly hope they NEVER get rid of those machines!  It's a friendly place and a must-visit stop on Fremont.  We had a blast and were only sorry that we couldn't come at night and get they whole ""Experience!""   We will be back!*note to self:  The drinks are stronger than they look.  We got the hurricane, white Russian, and mud slide flavors and enjoyed them all.  I think I liked my son's white Russian best because it tasted like vanilla ice cream.  YUM!

42,"It's still as divey as ever here at La Bayou Casino.  It's run down, cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings.  God knows I love this place!  It's one of the coolest places in downtown Vegas and they always get my business.From the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave, it's non-stop free drinks, cool employees and loose slots.You know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better.  Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.Their slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.Like I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).  They are part of the experience and if they ever leave, the place just won't be the same.Man I want to go back there right now.

43,"If you are in Vegas, YOU MUST COME HERE!!!!This was one of the highlights of my recent trip to Vegas. La Bayou offers REAL nickel slots, frozen daiquiris, FREE drinks (if you are gambling, but it's nickel slots), and a dive-bar atmosphere. Upon arriving you are greeted by two ladies dresses in traditional vegas show girl feathers who hand out beads to customers. The beads really add to the kitsch environment of Fremont Street and La Bayou. You are also handed a lottery ticket to enter to win up to $10,000, which was another source of free entertainment. The machines themselves work very well and it was so much fun playing actual coins and seeing them clink into the coin return tray. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly( Remember to TIP). I never had to worry about asking for another drink and the drinks were STRONG. La Bayou is a great time for the non-serious gambler who wants to enjoy their time in Vegas with cheesy promotions, strong drinks and a taste of whats left of old school Vegas. It's just a good time all around!

44,"Not bad food, but this place isn't really a ""restaurant"" as much as it is one of the best drinking holes in Las Vegas, with a slick interior done up with tasteful neon and big televisions, a square bar, and one of the sexiest staffs in town. Food is pretty good too, but excessive drinking may give a slanted opinion on that one.

45,"I really expected this place to be a disgusting, grimy, dive. I was shocked to discover a clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated bar and restaurant. We ordered the gyro sliders, feta fries, and artichoke dip; all were delicious! Beers were only $4, which is an amazing deal in this town! We signed up for the Ladies' Club and saved 25% on our bill. This place could easily become my new favorite bar.

If you really want to impress the vodka-lover you brought along then you better come here. Also, its in the Mandalay Hotel and Casino which is one of the better places to rest your feet in Las Vegas.

51,"One word: Chernobyl .  Start your night with this cocktail.  Whether you have to beg, borrow or video poker your way to the bargain $12 that this thing costs...DO IT.  If you like vodka (in my case LOVE vodka), or even if you don't, this is the cocktail to end all cocktails. It's got something close to 5 shots in it plus a float of stoli elite (5 different kinds of vodka).  But it gets better...the drink doesn't taste like vodka.  It tastes like a delectable cranberrylimefizzy thing that won't give you so much as a buzz.  It comes with a mutant-looking candie cinnimon stick that's a great touch.  Well worth it.  It's a vegas must-have.  Other than the drink, the bar is nifty- great decor (former USSR, the out-front statues head inside the frezzer, and bartops of ice).  Food is great but EXPENSIVE. The other drinks are great too...and I think they're fairly priced for the selection of vodkas, strength of drink and originality.
",others
52,"My friends and I had a real good time here. If you like expensive vodka, then this is your place. But to attain the ultimate experience is to purchase a bottle of vodka and drink it in the vodka freezer.  You get to put on Russain types of winter coats and drink off of a bar made of ice. Dean Cain and the guy that owns the Ivanko barbellcompany have a vodka locker there.  The manager of the place is so cool that in addition to the bottle that my friends and I had, he also let us taste other vodkas that they had available.   I was in pure vodka heaven.

57,"Mandana K, Dave H and myself wandered around Mandalay looking for any bar to be open at 3:30 in the afternoon.  We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin, signaling the entrance to the Red Square, which didn't open until 4 PM.  Once 4 arrived, we were the first to walk into the bar that day, taking seats at the bar, which is made out of ice.  Since this is a Russian-themed bar, they stock a wide assortment of vodkas.  On their menu, they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks.  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others.  Since there were only a few other patrons, we learned about the history of the place.  When the bar first opened, the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of Communism.  The bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony.  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker, a walk-in, sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter, you need to don a thick, russian like fur coat and hat.  We toured the locker, knocked back a shot of vodka, and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker.  For several thousand dollars a year, one can rent a space, store any vodka you please, have a name plate, and enter the locker any time you please.  Not a bad deal if split among the three of usWe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu.  We looked around.  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons, we exited as their last.  It was 4 AM.

58,"MMMM From Russia with Love-The Ice bar is beautiful and the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff will help you negotiate through the endless varieties of .... uh  .... wait..... oh yeah... vodka.  I recommend getting some flights and splitting them with friends. Vodka has as many genres as wine and each is a brilliant ice cold experience.   Gotta love those Ruskies!I also have to admit that they have a beautiful logo and the T-shirt is top notch.

I'd never...ever...leave.

60,"Mmm, tasty. Easily some of the best mixed drinks that I've ever had the pleasure of downing.I started off with a chocolate martini from the dessert menu, since their kitchen was closed and I still needed something sweet to finish off dinner. It was smooth without being overly cloying or creamy. Very drinkable and deliciously chocolatey. They even floated a white chocolate red square in the drink. Nice touch. I'm a lightweight, so that one martini was enough for me, but I did get to try some of my friends' drinks. The Chernobyl will knock you on your butt if you aren't careful, but it tastes like a yummy, barely alcoholic, fruit drink. You won't know what hit you until it's too late. They also have an outstanding black cherry vodkapinot noir martini that is really unique. I can't remember the name of it, but it's worth scouring the menu for. The decor is elegant but cheesy, and the booths are the best spot to sit and people watch. We were there from about 1:30am-2:30am on a Friday night and it was easy to grab some good seats and it was easy to chat without having to shout.

61,"I love this swanky joint..  If you are a vodka connoisseur andor like to try new or rare vodkas you will be in heaven.  Its a vodka bar in Mandalay Bay with so many brands and styles of vodka to choose from your head will be spinning.  I'm a Gibson fan (vodka martini w onion) so I asked the bartender what brand he recommended for a his favorite vodka martini served up..  I was introduced to Zyr (still not available in California) and this has since been my favorite brand.. Its filtered 9 times and distilled 5 times and it is smooth as water.  You can find distributors selling this on the internet - I've been getting it shipped to my house ever since my last Vegas trip..  :)  I'm heading out there again this weekend and will definitely make a stop into this place.  Food and apps are tasty, nice presentation, pricey (then again everything in vegas is a bit pricey)..decor is very cool with an overwhelming ""red"" theme and the top of the bar is actually made out of 1 huge ice block.  So if you set a drink on it it'll frost up and stay cold.  They have quite an extensive original martini list, most of them fruity.  They allow you to head back into the walk-in freezer with a fur coat if you are into that.  Overall great spot!  Love hitting this place up in the early evening..

62,"I know Playboy Club has it's own reviews. Moon I also went to for a play date. Coming upstairs to walk into the medley of lights and fiber optics was simply amazing. It was more of an upscale version of Rain. It has a beautiful view of the Vegas Skyline. What got to me was the floors being lit up. The tables are metal with a mirrored finish. It kinda made me feel like a pervert watching girls dance on it...BUT WHO CARES! The dance floor is huge and the patio area is just amazing. Moon's roof has a huge video screen kinda like the Fremont St Experience but this roof is supposed to retract. That night it didn't due to the slight sprinkling. Moon also has a second floor with another bar and another patio access. I had a great time there. But this is one of those places you probably want to get a table for. Music was great - laser and light show was pretty off the hook. Sound system very LOUD. What more can you expect from a monster club
",others
63,"This is a bonifide Vegas club!  Moon is located at the top of one of the Palms towers so the views are spectacular from the balcony to the restroom.  Yes, there's a floor-to-ceiling glass in the men's room.  And a urinal right next to it that makes it the one of the most breathtaking p!$$ spots in the world.  The club is also connected to the high-roller Playboy casino lounge where you can celebrity hunt.  The drinks are as stiff as the prices so bring lots of cash and drink heavily before you arrive.  The security staff was very courteous and helpful.Just be sure you arrive early, as in right after dinner, otherwise, you'll be spending a lot of time in line downstairs and you might not get in at all.  Once you're in, you're in.  Vegas Style, Baby!

64,"Fabulous club.I loved my night at Moon.We did bottle serviceVIP here and it was well worth the cost.  Well, okay - so we did bottle service for the boys, and for the girls - we got ourselves in but it took all of 15 seconds.   The management, bouncers and serversbusboys were all FABULOUS.  EXCELLENT service all around, I'd give it 10 stars if i could.   Every single person working at Moon that I had to deal with or talk to on this night was nothing short of stellar, and the treatment they gave us was  first-class all around.  The way they had us enter was straight through the Playboy Lounge, and what I saw of that place, I was not impressed.  Head up the escalators to Moon and then voila - - - your night begins and all of Moon is conducive to having a good time.  We ended up getting a table in a separate VIP lounge area, a good distance away from the dancefloor which made it possible to talk as well as drink in private.  There are booths everywhere - and all of  them were nicely set up and comfortable, well-placed, etc.  But I never like sitting too close to the dancefloor where people are falling into your table, or you can't even hear yourself think, so this was perfect.  When you opt for bottle service at Moon, the service leaves you wanting for nothing, nothing at all!  To make a reservation, there is a form to fill out and you do have to hold with your CC unless they know you.  It was relatively easy, and even those in our party who were late got in without a glitch just by mentioning the name under which I'd made reservations.  Very smooth process.Great music, great crowd, and a gorgeous club, to boot.  The patio area outside was fabulous - - view of the whole city, and lots of perfect photo opps out there.  Take a drink outside and get your groove going, come inside and dance the night away.  I would not have minded having a table outside reserved, and might do that the next time I am in Vegas.Three bottles later - - we were all nicely toasted, and I think everyone could agree that it was a great time.  FYI:  Don't pass out.  If you pass out cold in a drunken stupor - they will ask that you be escorted out.  One of my friends had just this happen to him, and when I came back from dancing - - he was gone.  Hahahaha....I'd go back to Moon at any time without any hesitation.  GREAT club, and perhaps one of the best in Vegas at this time.  GO GO GO!!

65,"Awesome club.  Loved it absolutely loved it.  Maybe it was the fact that the bachelorette party I was in tacked on to a really cute set of bachelors at a bachelor party there and had a bottle service and therefore a table and therefore a place to sit but this club was great.  Fabulous music and a great dance floor.  The gogo dancers were awesome (not like some places where you look at the gogo dancer go and you cannot help but think to yourself .. hey I could do a better job)  and the bar tenders were seriously on top of there stuff.  Fabulous.  Great people at this place and girls... the best thing.. the line at the bathroom moved quickly and there was practically no wait.  fantastic.  Oh and another thing for all of you out there.  I totally danced to my hearts content and talked to fantastically cute boys.  (for those who might be getting worried that I was never going to find a date.. yet.. Vegas might not count but still.. I had a great time)...  The Grey goose apple martini was to die for and figi water was what you could buy at the bar.  Check it out for sure if you can.

67,"It's places like these that makes me proud to be from here.  On a visit to my hometown, I stepped into this place via my peoples people.  They had nice bouncers, wonderful bartenders, fucking the best music I've ever heard at a clubraveloungestore ever, and laxed security.  They even let the girls rotate and go up and dance next to their residential dancers.  Their residential dancers were also better than those at other clubs like PURE.  This venue is definitely smaller than Rain and lacks the pyrotechnic capabilities, but it has a great view of the strip.  Once you get in, you can also visit the Playboy Lounge.  It is a great visit as well.  As always, make sure you are looking fierce to go.  =)  I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town...

On this night I didn't have to worry about these things thanks to a friend of a friend of a friend who got us in without waiting and without a cover (we were more than happy to give him a nice tip though)  So we walk past the line and I'm feeling like Wayne and Garth holding up their backstage passes in Wayne's World.We get up to Moon and I'm thinking ""Maybe I should change my whole anti-club attitude!"" This place was great - awesome music, some outdoor space with amazing views of Vegas and one floor down, the Playboy Club - a casino that features Playboy bunnies as dealers.

Not once did I remember leaving the bar. Things have slowed down a bit since then, mostly because I've also learned to never order more then two drinks. It's also tiny, so if you want to sit down, get there early (or go during the week). Weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire place.

78,"This is a total hidden gem. I was unaware that this bar existed till a friend took me here. We were sitting across the street at Mario's and he says to me, ""You want to go some place else and get some STRONG drinks"" This proposition not only got me excited, but piqued my interest. Where are we going and why don't I know about this placeOnce we made it inside and up the long set of stairs (I can see myself taking a digger down these after a few Manhattens) you enter the dark, semi smokey bar. This place is divey but not dirty. It just looks they decorated it about 25 years ago and if it was good enough then, damnit its good enough now. The juke box is loaded with classic jazz and blues and normally operates at the guidance of the bartender (which is fine by me, he has good taste.)The bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar. He makes his drinks fast, tall, and strong. The average cocktail (whiskey and coke, vodka and juice, gin and tonic) run about $6 and some of their others (Manhattan, martinis, etc) cost $8. The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, its worth it. You are getting a rocks glass with little ice, filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice, and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink. If I'm going to spend $15 in a bar I would rather drink 2 well made, strong drinks than drink 15 cups of coke each with an eye dropper's worth whiskey.  If you want a place to listen to some good music, get schwacked on liquor, and enjoy some conversation, Mardi Gras is you joint.

79,"Some serious old school 80's glamour waits up the long flight of stairs to Marti Gras.  There's something magical about this dive--even the smoke doesn't seem to bother me...Actually, it's probably the strong drinks that are responsible for that...Which may be made with magic.  Who can say  But I'm a sucker for any sort of sweet vodka cocktail in a martini glass, and the drinks here will knock a girl off her heels.  Luckily, there's always an attentive bartender waiting to mix one more cocktail.But this ain't no college dive.  You won't find too many kids in here, which I appreciate.  It's dark up those stairs and the jukebox jazz is often questionable, but the booths are cozy and the drinks are tall and the beer selection is more than decent.  I'll take it.P.S. - It was cash only last time I checked.

80,"This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh! The drinks will punch you in the face, if that weird looking guy next to you won't. It's a great escape from the bro-scene that is most of Walnut St. and they have booths which themselves would be enough to make me love this place. I've had many sloppy nights here and made many stranger friends. Order a greyhound and watch the bartender squeeze fresh juice into your drink and kick it with strangers at the bar.

81,"Mardi Gras is a far cry from most other bars in Shadyside, and in the best possible way.  Dark, smoky, smaller than most establishments, frequented by older patrons and a jukebox with fantastic music from the 60s onward are just a few traits that make Mardi Gras a fantastic barroom.Add to that exceptionally strong, but delicious, drinks, and bartenders that like to keep their clients pleased, and you've got a combination that's hard to find anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  Mardi Gras also has a perfect nostalgic feeling to it.  The wall across from the bar is lined with several large booths that easily accommodate a group of five or six and invite conversation over your stiff drinks.The bar is cash only, which may seem like a little deterrent, but after you've had a couple mixed drinks you'll probably thank yourself for not being able to charge away too many more.  Not to mention the awesome cash register that looks like it's about 90 years old.By far, Mardi Gras is my preferred bar in Shadyside, and you can't go wrong if you're in the mood for a strong drink.

How do they make moneyIs it the best burger  No.  Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten  Yes.  Definitely.  Everything is well thought out right down the to the bun choice.  The burgers all come with kettle chips.  I hate kettle chips.  Hate them.  You know what  I ate theirs.  So good.  Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast.  The server was friendly and precise (I did not want onions, I did not get onions).  That care barely be said about high end restaurants.  It was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came.  They are huge.  I had a cheeseburger.  I barely made it through half.  They are cooked medium well, but they are still so juicy.  The vegetables are fresh and generous.  I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger.  My friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  I could barely see the burger under the bacon.  It was amazing.  I dared not try that on my first time out.  I can not wait to try their hot ham and cheese.  It comes with two HUGE slices of ham.  They have brunch on Sundays.  I am talking myself down from finding any excuse to go there again.

I have also been to the Eagle Crest on Taco Tuesday. Prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see. If you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings. It's great. More than any one person can eat in one sitting. This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time. Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food. Since this is a bar, maybe the best Bloody Mary in town. It comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp, a beef stick, pickle, and green olives. A meal in itself. If your hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place I would suggest.My new favorite bar.

89,"Yum, yum, yum.  I felt the need to update the restaurant.  Nothing has changed and that is what I love!Consistency is appreciate when the quality is so high.  I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always.  They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy.  The truth is, they stick to good, simply and quality food.  So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous.

90,"One liner:  perch rocksIf you are looking for an awesome perch fish fry, Villa is your place.  One of the best I have eaten...light greasing and no grease.  It is Canadian Lake perch if that matters to anyone.Small and cozy neighborhood bar!

91,"My husband and I love this little gem of a neighborhood bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best ""bar burger"" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating ""townie-bar"" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!

92,"If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.  We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.
",others
93,"Looks sketch from the outside, but true fish fry happiness awaits! I have been going to this place for about one year.  The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  I had an amazing hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  The perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato.  The craft beer selection is impressive.  Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it. It's now my go to place for fish!

94,"I started going here on and off about eight years ago. The pizza is the best, but the burgers (veggie and regular) are very good as well. It's bar food at its very best. Hot chips with dipping sauce are good too! There's often bands on the weekends, and the occasional lesbian after bowling league get together, but not angry, man-hating, shemales. Quite a few different groups of people get together for good beer, food and music at reasonable prices.

96,"The Harmony - or the Har Bar as my friends call it, is always an inviting and friendly place to have a beer.  It's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of Madison.  The food is really nice, an up-scaled bar menu.  The signature dish, the ""Walnut Burger"" is truly fantastic.  Forget about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings.  The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.  Here you will find the livers of the pure Madison lifestyle celebrating their lives.  These people are happy and they might just make you happy too.
",others
97,"The hubby and I always default to Harmony Bar when we have a craving for a good burger and a local brew (even before noon). My favorite is the blue burger-a burger smothed in blue cheese and all the traditional toppings. The pizzas are worth waiting for-check on the days and times they'll make a pizza for you.As always a smoke free environment is worth driving to Madison for.
",others
98,"Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!  I never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when I'm back in town.  This is just a wonderful neighborhood bar.  The food is still ""bar"" food but it's quality, tasty and made fresh to order.  The pizza is good, too.  Good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere.  The Harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhood.Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!
",others
99,"The perfect place for the near-east side. Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town.

I use to be a vegetarian and I would dream about eating that thing, better than meat any day of the week.I use to use to...  Good times :)

I enjoy the food, the walnut burger was super different and interesting, and although I prefer the beef it was fun to try something different.The rest of the food was as good as bar food gets, but the staff and general feel of the bar (I love the old school jukebox!) makes it 5 stars for me.

Even in the city of Chicago you will not find a chicken strip as good as here.  They are huge! If these were indeed the fingers of a chicken they would be of some mutant killer robot chicken that could probably kill us all.The service can be pretty surly and they are kind of nickel and dime nazis with the water and sauce.  But the chicken...oh the chicken.

I usually get Papa Johns large pineapple for 5 bucks, but it gets old. This is good ""Italian"" pizza. (as italian as they say they are.)Anyway, I keep reading all these rave reviews about the chicken tenders, and as I waited for my pizza, multiple people came in and ordered those chicken tenders, so they must be good.But back to my pizza, it was AMAZING. I took 2 slices and and im not even hungry anymore. THis baby is gonna last me for the rest of the night and at least 1 slice for breakfast tomorrow.55 stars A+

106,"This was one of my top places to go on campus. It's cheap, the food is delicious and you get EXTREMELY large portions. I probably have tried everything on their menu from one time to another and they definitely do a better job with certain dishes than others. But the ones they do well can't be beat. The Top 5 things are: 1. Chicken Fingers - These things are the sizes of your forearm and come with a great honey mustard sauce. Bet you can't finish a 5-piece! 2. Gyro - I love their gyro's! Even though you have Zorba's and Niro's Gyros close by I would still go with Geo's if not just for their shear size! You can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! 3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! 4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! I would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. 5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! The only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed. But at the same time you know it's good if there's a line out the door every night!  I miss you Geovanti's!
",others
107,"Cheap, amazing chicken strips.Everything else I've had here is kind of low quality though.  The pasta sauce has no flavor and the gyros are garbage.However, the chicken strips deserve the 5 star rating due to the great value and the great taste.

A lot of alums with their original mug club cards.

Our ""wardrobe expert"" (and I feel terrible because I forgot his name) was incredibly friendly and helpful that I couldn't help but think - WHY DON'T THEY HAVE STORES LIKE THIS FOR WOMEN!!  Someone who helps you - no matter your size or height, finds you the pants that fit your body, the dress shirts, the jackets, etc.  This man was absolutely STELLAR!  Incredibly personable and he knew his job well.  The BF left with exactly what he needed and I may or may not have talked him into a few other items... What can I say, I like a sharp dressed man (cue ZZ Top).  So if you're looking to make your man a little more stud-ly with a jacket, tie, dress shirt, or perhaps a full suit, stop by Men's Warehouse.  You'll be drooling over him in no time ;)

When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.

114,"oh, Eons, how you've spoiled me so.I remember visiting Richard's shop when it was where Hey Betty! is now.  Trying on monkey fur trimmed capes and Hungarian peasant vests.  Needless to say, they know me and my chihuahua by name.Eon's selection is amazing.  Richard is a collector, a curator, a Pittsburgh god of vintage.  He hand selects every piece in the shop and will not sell anything if a seam is ripped, a button or belt is missing, or if it's just stupid. He has every item laundered and pressed to perfection.  Everything is a gem, and Richard will tell you a bit about where he got the piece and why its design is important.  PRICEY!!  gawd.  Everything at Eons is a bargain for the quality you are getting.Growing up on Eons' vintage has spoiled me for any other vintage store.  I hold every other one up to its standards.  Thus, vintage in LA is a joke.  A cruel, un-laundered, over-priced, wrinkled, moth-eaten joke of the thrift variety.
",others
115,"I love the clothes he has, I love the prices, I love how helpful Richard is.  It's got a great location, and it's relative to Hey Betty!  Which is another pretty good vintage shop.  Eons is better though.  They have clothes for all sizes and shapes.  Beautiful shoes and jewelry as well.  And Richard (god of vintage) is just a gem to talk to!
",others
116,"I think I died and went to vintage nirvana when I stepped into Eons back in May. Every single piece is elegant, beautiful, and either close to mint condition or mint condition. Richard, the guy that runs the store, knows about every piece in the store and a bit of its history. Literally, the store is like walking into a museum of clothing from the 1940s-1980s. Hey Betty is really great too, although sometimes it doesn't have the sizes I need (I'm a petite 0-2). Also look up when you walk around the store. Some of the sweetest hats I have ever seen (I don't know where they find the stuff in that GREAT quality) are at Eons. Main point: If you love vintage, you will LOVE Eons.

The owner Richard is top-notch and knows his stuff inside and out.   My only regret is that I didn't have more days to visit...maybe that good thing, because honestly, I don't think I would have left the store.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd be making weekly (maybe even daily) journeys to the store.I'm an experienced vintage shopper and baby - it doesn't get better than this!  And the prices - very reasonable for the quality of the clothing, which is all cleaned and tenderly loved.

It may be packed full but it's easy to navigate between the different decades as they are clearly marked in select sections.  The prices aren't outrageous if you're looking for something unique for a special dinner or event.  You can tell that the owner goes above and beyond to find the best vintage selections.  It's not just clothes too, but gorgeous jewelry and a very unique selections of vintage eyewear.

This is one of the only vintage clothing stores I've been to in the country that has a large selection of deadstock items, complete with their original tags.  The dresses I have purchased here are absolutely amazing, many of them never worn.  I will continue to visit on my quarterly P-burgh visits!

120,"Eons was the first vintage store I ever went to at the tender age of 15 when I was going through my rockabilly phase.  I've gone back many times since, and even got my junior year homecoming dress and accessories here (it was a red '50s swing dress).  It remains the best vintage store in Pittsburgh, and possibly the best vintage place I've been to period.  Eons carries mainly clothing, shoes, accessories and jewelry from the '40-'80s, but don't be surprised to find pieces from the very early 1900s!  It's organized by men's and women's clothing, then by type of garment, and then by size.  Speaking of sizes, there is a wide selection, which is so nice as a larger vintage-lover. Everything is in tip-top condition and very reasonably priced, and the staff are beyond helpful and knowledgeable.  I've never left empty handed at Eons, and I dare you to not find something you love!

121,"There are thrift stores and there are vintage stores.  There are some stores that are a blend of the two.  And then there's Eons.  Eons goes beyond your average vintage shop in that it could be considered a museum of fashion.   A lot of their stuff is one-of-a kind antique clothing.  You can easily find stuff from the 1930s up to the 1980s.  Heck, in a few years we'll be looking at 1990s grunge here--time to dig out the Soundgarden CDs.  I once bought a clutch purse here.  I stopped in the other day and even though I couldn't find anything that quite caught my eye, it was still a lot of fun poking around in here.

124,"We went to the Men's Wearhouse to outfit our wedding party with tuxes. We worked with Jack, who assisted us beyond our expectations. It turned out that we could buy suits for all of the groomsmen for less than a tux rental would cost. This meant that our wedding party got to keep their suits after the wedding and use them for business or other purposes - they were theirs! Jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties, which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift. I don't think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us find.Everyone looked great, and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit, shirt, and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux. And I've returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party - often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of town.Jack has continued to be a great resource, alerting me to sales and helping me pick out what's best for my business attire even after wedding. I used to be a solely Brooks Brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts, mainly because I travel a lot and value the non-iron shirts that BB offers (I HATE ironing shirts). But Jack introduced me to lines that Men's Wearhouse carries and the non-iron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at Brooks Brothers. Though a bit pricey at about $85-95shirt normally, Men's Wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at $42-47.I can't speak about anyone other than Jack (he seems to always be there!), but I can't recommend him or this store highly enough. If you are looking to outfit your wedding party, or just in need of some business clothes, talk to him - he will take care of you!

Luckily the Men's Wearhouse has finished bottoms in many sizes and the bf walked out with a couple of pairs of pants, socks, and a belt.

He also gave recommendations on shirt and tie combinations. They were having a 40% off sale on the entire store so we got a great deal. They were also able to tailor the suit pants within 4 days.

Stopped in and was greeted by Carmello. Said a nice hello and let me do my thang. After I couldn't find the shirt I was looking for he jumped in to help- The dude was awesome, by far the best service experience I have ever had at any one of their stores. I got my shirt, a matching tie and a new belt, all for about $100- not bad. He took my measurements right so I got stuff that is comfortable too (kind of the key to getting me to wear it a second time) and was that perfect balance of offering suggestions combined with actually listening to what I was saying.

We did a fair amount of online research into the color  style we were aiming for and knew which suit we really wanted to see upon arrival.We were greeted as we entered the store and the employee walked us directly over to the suit we were seeking so that we could see the fit and ensure it was good to go. The exact size that we needed was not available in the store, however, they were happy to order it for us and it was in within about a week.  They do alterations on site, so you don't need to worry about the suit being sent offsite and they take about two weeks to get done (they will rush them for you if needed - we had the time).  Tomorrow we plan to pick up his altered suit and we'll be all set to go!All the groomsmen seemed to have good experiences in their local stores as well, so it's not a bad chain to choose for all the men in you party if you are looking for a good national chain to make things convenient like we were!Overall: AGreat experience, quick order fulfillment and alterations on site.  We would recommend them to friends!

After getting measured for the tailoring, Emmett told me that it would take until (I think) Thursday. I explained that I would need the suit a bit sooner than that. Emmett was very accomodating and arranged for it to be available Tuesday. Perfect!Emmett was also great in that when I explained my budget constraints, he didn't try to upsell me (which has happened before) and he didn't leave me when he found out that I wasn't a big spender.I like the way I look in the suit, which is also important. But it's the high standard of excellent service that has won me as a client for as long as I need suits. Bottom line, gentlemen, if you need a suit, go talk to Emmett.

137,"I am a sales associate for a company called Sleep America.  I have an appreciation for sales techniques and I am a tough critic. I was greeted immediately by a man named Alex Parsons with a smile. He was dressed sharp and was very clean cut. He asked a few qualifying questions which I appreciated. I had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match. He asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size. He then asked if I would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with. (which was a seamless transition into an upsell... much appreciated) but the important thing to note... he asked not told. I said absolutely I would. He pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles. I decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool. (great quality as well) I asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble. Unfortunately I have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size. He even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look. I felt like I was getting royal treatment and Alex spent a great amount of time with me, answering all of my questions, and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space. I decided to purchase the slacks, with a permanent crease, and had them hem the slacks as well. I was out the door with a new belt, a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot! Thank you Alex for all of your great work. I have already referred a co-worker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts. The Tempe Marketplace store is fantastic, but more importantly, Alex was fantastic. I would prep him for a promotion if I was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager. If anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location, call and ask for Alex. He really suprised me because many of the reviews are so-so. He was unlike any other associate at nordstrom or macys (which is where I usually get my clothing) Call and set an appointment with him, you won't regret it!Thanks again, Alex Danesi

139,"Used this location for my Wedding Tux rental.  There are 11 total rentals for my upcoming wedding - Me, Best Man, 5 Groomsmen, 2 Dads (biological and step), and 2 ring bearers (twin boys).  They got me in, and out in about 30 minutes for the initial meeting.  They explained all the options, pricing, etc.  Very professional.  The ""kid"" (probably 22) didn't provide much assistance or recommendations...but the other staffers that assisted me did.  This part of the review I would give 4 stars - slightly better than average serviceetc.  1 star deducted because I HAVE to pick up the tux 2 days before the wedding and not the day before.Popped in there this past weekend for the fittingmeasurements - was in and out in 5 minutes!  But then I decided to browse (bc using the voucher towards a new suit vs the free tux).  Emmett H. - was there to assist me. I didn't think I needed assistance (bought many suits in my life) - but Emmett was great.  He has a calm professional demeanor about him.  He was very knowledgeable about all the suits and the origins, fabric, stitching, etc.  Very very helpful.  He then helped me look at this fantastic suit - Italian made, imported wool, German stitching style - Top Notch.  I can't wait to pick it up.  Emmett said he has 2 (I believe) FT Tailors on-hand and can have the alterations done relatively quickly (permitting demand).  I think Emmett is my new Suit-Guy in AZ!Overall - 4.5 stars.  Emmett gets 5, the store 4, so overall 4.5.

140,"As a recent college graduate, I went to get a suit for my current and future job interviews. I already had a list of my preference in hand as I walked into the store. I was immediately greeted by a sales associate who looked over my list and found exactly what I wanted. The suit he grabbed also qualified for their buy one, get one free program so I ended up getting two suits. My interview was the next day, so they were able to get it tailored in time for the interview and I pick up my second suit today (one week later). I was in and out in 30 minutes. Yes, they will try to sell you dress shirts, ties, socks, shoes, tie bars, etc, but if you know what you want, then its not a big deal. I highly recommend this location (by superstition mall) and will be returning here in the future to get alterations done on some of my other clothes.

141,"One of the disadvantages of being a lean, tall guy that likes to stay in shape is that it is absolutely impossible to find clothes that fit.  My neck is small, and my arms are long, so I have no choice but to have my clothing either custom-manufactured or altered.Artful Tailoring is on point in all regards.  The owner, Aladdin Dimas, a native of Damascus, Syria, has been learning the trade since he was 14.  He knows cool, and he knows how to accentuate the best and worst parts of the human figure.  His prices are very fair, and his textile collection is world-class.Go check him out.  He's put together an above-average website which you can access by clicking on the above link to the business' info, and I suggest you do so.In the market for a new shirt  Don't settle for a 'fitted' Kenneth Cole... go give Aladdin a shot!  He'll make you look like a million bucks!

Worth the drive.  Nice, unassuming.  Does great work.  I hate when I get pants hemed and the tailor plays chicken and egg with you.       ""Do you want it like this (moves the pant leg up 14"") or like this     (moves it down)""  This guy will take one look, make a mark and done.  Perfect every time.

It's been a while since I have been in, but I have given them everything from my Lucky Brand sweats, to Ann Taylor slacks to an old pair of jeans for mending! I've never had a bad experience here and their prices are fair. Service is fantastic and you can count on your clothes being ready when promised! The store is clean and has an upscale feel.

After they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done, I could really see how a good suit is supposed to look.  This place rocks.  If I had to do it all over again, I would visit the Tailor BEFORE even going out to buy a suit.  He helps you know what to look for in a suit.

150,"A few years ago, I had an unfortunate experience at Artful Tailoring. Recently, the owner reached out to me after reading review. He regretted the situation and wanted to make it right.I have a back log of clothes that need to be altered so I was happy to meet with him again. I knew he could be trusted with the more complicated items (i.e. anything other than pants that need hemming) because of the work he did for me previously.This time I had two dresses taken in at the shoulders and a pair of jeans taken in at the waist. The first dress had embroidery at the shoulders so he did an ""easy fix"" that involves folding the material. I was a little hesistant at first, but it looks good and fits even better. I've never had jeans taken in before so I was worried how they would turn out. Now my beloved mint jeans fit perfectly with just two small darts sewn in the back. They aren't really noticable, and besides, I usually wear my shirts untucked anyways.All the work was ready when promised. I'll be back soon to have some more clothing shortened to fit my midget frame.

151,"A few weeks ago I heard a story that this location was selling suits 2 for 1.  I didn't believe this until I got there.  How could any place make a deal like this  I ended up getting paired up with a guy named Gabe.  Instantly I thought he was your typical men's clothing store kind of guy until I started peppering him with questions.  Very quickly it became apparent Gabe knew a lot more about both casual and business suits.  I had specific ideas for my suits as they needed to breathe well.  After showing me several different types of suits Gabe picked out 5 suits and I loved eash instantly.  I then had to cut down to two suits for the final purchase.  He then talked about the positives and negatives of each suit.  There wasn't any BS spewing, just facts and numbers and personal opinion.  I will be back to the store monthly to see what the latest sales.  Thanks for all your help Gage!  Sorry to ask a million questions.

152,"Awesome staff! The guy who helped me was named Skip happened to be a suit wizard and got me in and out with exactly what I was looking for.

153,"I give this place six stars and a bag of chips!!I was an usher in a wedding today. When I arrived at church, i realized that I left my tie (which was by design the same as the other ushers and groomsmen) at home and did not have enough time to go home to get it...SO with the help of Yelp, I found a nearby Men's Wearhouse and called them to explain the problem while heading over. They said they had a silver tie but it might not match exactly. At this point I'm like ""a silver tie that doesn't exactly match is waaaaay the heck better than NO tie"".When I got there an EXTREMELY nice saleslady informed me that they had the exact silver tie over at another store and she would be happy to:1. Give me the almost-but-not-perfectly-matching silver tie so I could get back to the church to get to my usher duties and2. Drive up to the store that had the exact matching tie and then drive over to the church to DELIVER IT...Now, like most folks, I don't love asking people I don't know for favors and this was A LOT to ask for a tie, but I've heard brides can be particular about stuff pertaining to their weddings so I figured since she was willing then erroring on the side of safety would be a good way to go. so I left with the one tie to do my usherly duties and a bit later, the unbelievably kind sales lady showed up at church with the legit tie.  Wow... this was so far above and beyond what I've come to expect from anyone in business, I'm still kind of thinking that that will probably never happen again...OH yeah, I forgot... they did all of this for free. I didn't have to pay extra for the tie or her time to run get it. Nada.Anyways, like I said... 6 stars plus a bag of chips.

The staff is amazing, the location is amazing and the facility is one of the best maintained fitness centers in Charlotte.My favorite classes are Kickboxing, Cycle, Athletic Conditioning and Zumba.  Note:  I recently started taking Zumba at GWVY and the sessions have been great.The KB instructor is simply amazing.  The class and all of the participants are like a family.   The great thing about the Y also is that we often get together after a great class...and go to some of the best restaurants (see my reviews) in the downtown area.In addition to the great facility, the GWV Y does amazing things for the community and offers great opportunities to volunteer!I highly recommend the GWV Y for total mind, body and spirit!!!****I miss my KB instructor but have really enjoyed taking the occasional Turbo Kick class.  The structure and queuing is different ...but can provide a good workout.

155,"I worked out here for about a month and a half when I was working in Charlotte.  The locker rooms and the equipment are all very clean, and you always have a fresh towel available to you.  The staff that work here are super nice, friendly, and are always willing to lend a hand.  I like this Y better than the other ones around Charlotte mostly because it's not always super crowded and you almost never have to wait to use a machine.  I really like the classes- especially spin - I forgot her name but my lady (she was pregnant at the time) was always motivating and kept me going!  It's a nice cozy little gym that is very convenient if you live within walking distance.  Parking is readily available too if you aren't.
",others
156,"This is a really great gym! It's very well maintained and always clean, the equipment is in good shape, and you just can't say no to towel service. The staff and instructors are tremendously nice and helpful, and the crowd is laid back without the ""strutting"" that you can see at other gyms. I never see it packed or desolate, so there's always a good atmosphere of activity without having to stand around waiting on equipment.
",others
157,"Besides being super convenient to get to, the Gateway Y is clean and the staff is very friendly!My husband and I had been going to the Dowd since we got our membership, and although I like the Dowd, it was getting more and more crowded- having to show up for a class 30 minutes before its starts isn't always feasible!  The Gateway always has plenty of class space- most classes I've attended have had less than 6 people, which is so great!All the equipment is very new and clean and you can always find a machine without any wait time- and never have a problem getting a bike for Spin (even showing up 5 minutes before).This is now our go to Y during the week!
",others
158,"I love the Gateway Village Y.  The staff are very friendly and do a great job keeping the facility clean.  Unlike some of the other Y's in the area, Gateway is typically not super crowded.  Its a great place to go to take group exercise classes.Be sure to look up the parking codes on their branch website so you can park in the parking lot right beside the Y after 4:30 each weeknight.  Otherwise you have to park in the parking deck up the street.

It's the perfect place to get in a quick workout on your own or try a class.The Gateway Village YMCA is small but I've never seen it overly crowded. Cardio machines and weights are on the main level with the locker rooms; the group exercise rooms are downstairs. Check the website for parking information (I walk there but there's a free lot [with access code] in the evenings and they validate up to 2 hours in the garage).

161,"By far the best gymwork out facility in Charlotte.  Going to the Dowd Y is like going to work out and then going to the spa, it is a completely rejuvenating experience that's a great way to start... or end your day.  I always leave the Y feeling fresh and clean and more alive than when I went in.  Not only do they have a completely renovated downstairs weight room, a number of racquetball and handball courts, row upon row of exercise bikes, treadmills and elliptical machines, but they also have top notch classes, trainers and programs.  The Dowd has classes at different times throughout the day, so no matter what your schedule, chances are you can find a yoga class, or a spin class that works for you.The Men's Locker Room ( I can't comment on the women's as I've never been in there) also boasts an exercise room featuring cardio machines and some free weights as well as areas to stretch and warm-up. There's also a  huge whirlpool, steam room and sauna.  After a grueling workout, nothing beats the sauna, steam ,shower. combo.  The whirlpool relaxes your muscles.  The sauna opens up your pores, while the steam room helps clean out your respiratory system allowing you to feel revitalized , and the showers wash away the sweat and dirt from your workout preparing you to face the world at the top of your game.The Dowd YMCA is a great place; with state of the art equipment , programs, classes and  people.

162,"For the money, you really can't beat this deal.  For half as much as I was paying for my gym membership in Chicago, I get an all-access membership to the YMCAs in Charlotte.  The facilities are great, the staff are all helpful, and the Dowd Branch (probably the best location) is near my home.I have heard a lot about the locker break-ins, but have been lucky so far (knock on wood).Nice work, YMCA!
",others
163,"I grew up attending the Harris YMCA so working downtown and making the switch to the Dowd was quiet a change.  There aren't screaming kids or summer camps just adults getting fit.  The classes there are awesome and pretty much every member of my office takes 1-2 every week.  The women's locker room has a great little work out area of it's own, nestled right in between the lockers and only a few feet away from the showers.  It's perfect for when you need to be in and out, or if you just enjoy working out in a smaller area.  There is a sweet spot for treadmills on the 3rd floor.  They face out so you can watch joggers run up E. Morehead and think about how much harder they are running then you are, as you run in place.  Nevertheless, the 3rd floor is never as crowded as the second and you will definitely see regulars.  The showers are clean and the steam and sauna are perfect for when you feel it's time for a spa day, or even hour.
",others
164,"The Dowd Y is by far the best workout facility in the area for the money. From their class selection to workout equipment to friendly staff, you can't beat this gym. With a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the YMCAs in Charlotte, this gym is the best bang for your buck. In terms of classes, the Total Strength and Roc-it Circuit Training are great if you like direction when doing any sort of strength training. The Pilates, Yoga, Cardio Dance and Cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day. Only class that gave me pause was Athletic Conditioning - instructor bellowing orders at me over loud speakers for 60 minutes just isn't my cup of tea - but it is apparently a great workout as people come out of it drenched in sweat. I've very rarely seen an ""out-of-order"" sign on any equipment, and with multiple floors (including weight and cardio equipment in the ladies locker room), you hardly ever have to wait for a machine. Staff is uber-helpful and always cheery no matter what time of the day. Fair warning: parking can be a bit difficult in the evenings, and is downright ridiculous in January with all the newcomers. So if you're trying to make one of the multiple group exercise classes, give yourself extra time to park to save yourself some stress. Overall great experience; I highly recommend this gym.
",others
165,"This Y is by far the best offered in Charlotte.  I really can't think of a reason to give it less than 5 stars.  The only sticky issue can be parking if you come during peak hours.  This facility is spacious with multiple floors of equipment.  There are always receptionists at the front desk available to answer questions (or in my case help me when I forget my card).  I use the women's gym most often which has machines, free weights, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, and showers.  Not to mention they offer free use of their hair dryers and clean fresh towels!!  The locker room is always in pristine condition.  In fact, I've never walked in when a maintenance woman wasn't there!  They also have an array of classes to meet anyone's needs!  Some of the other services available that I haven't used are:- childcare-pro-shop (sell gym gear, drinks, power bars, etc).-poolLove this place!

166,"So since I have given up on Inner Peaks (boo) I have needed a new gym to get myself back into shape...a couple friends recommended Dowd and after a tour I was convinced this would be a great place for me. Wow this gym is like Globo gym in Dodge-Ball!  7 (or 8) floors, pretty much every type of service you could look for....smoothie bar, dietician, towel service etc.   They keep things fun and interesting with unique classes ..so since I get bored easily this is the main attraction for me! While I think some of the classes are a bit too jam packed, I do think the instructors do a nice job of motivating everyone and offering some individualized attention. I've really liked the pool facilities - and have even ventured into the hot-tub (scary at most gyms, but really is kept up here). I still recommend wearing flip-flops and showering beforeafter just in case. I'm totally with Nicole in that kiddies are cute and all but not when I am trying to work out- so I like that I know the pool has never been peed in!Overall as a few people mentioned this place isn't completely perfect - parking's a B and  I feel they could amp up the AC in Keith gym but overall it really has exceeded my expectations!

167,"I never knew I could love a gym so much! So if you look at this gym from the outside, it looks a bit outdated. Before I started going, I knew alot of people went there which perplexed me since it looks more like an office building from the 60's rather than a gym. But step on it and everything changes..... They have a beautiful lounge area that reminds me of a lounge area on a cruise ship. Tons of comfy seats, windows and free wi fi too! Free wifi at the gym Yes, I totally go to the YMCA to get my wi fi on. They also have a cafeteria-esque food joint. I can do that because of the spacious locker rooms they have. They have lockers you can rent out on the monthly or bring your own lock and use one of the daily use ones. In the women's locker room they have the standard showers, whirlpool, sauna, steam room but they also have a separate workout room down there complete with cardio machines, machines and free weights. Their showers are bigger than the ones at my house which is pretty small so I can go workout, shower, dry my hair, go to the lounge and ""lounge"" with free wifi for a couple of hours. Oh yeah, I guess I should talk about the actual gym component eh I've been to different Y's in Charlotte and Y's in other cities and the Dowd has the most recent models of treadmills, ellipticals and weight machines I've seen. For people without cable (like me) they have tons of machines with tv's, hooray!! Yeah, it gets busy in the morning or right after work but they are open until 10pm on weeknights so there is more than enough time to go!

168,"Join this gym!  I've just moved to Chicago and I miss the Dowd Y so much!  This gym is always clean, there are always employees of some sort nearby doing their job of assistance or cleaning.  Their is plenty of equipment, but peak times can exhaust what's available.  I don't care, I like a busy gym.  Empty ones are dull and boring.Be sure to attend athletic conditioning classes conducted by Becky (if you're advanced) and Roy ( if you're not yet advanced).  They're fantastic and worth the time, you may have to crawl to your car the first time.  Also take yoga from Jonathan or Mary.  All the instructors are very good, but these are my favorites.  I miss you guys!

169,"First of all, this place is phenomenal.  I have a membership to the Morrison (close to work), but decided to come try out Dowd on the weekend since it's so close to my house.I walked in and asked where the cardio machines are.  The staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the Women's locker room and the rest were on the next floor.  I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was SHOCKED.  And I really do mean I was floored.  The Women's locker room has to be about 2,000 sq ft!  It's enormous!  There is basically a Women's gym inside the locker room!  I fell in love.  Lockers, a Jacuzzi, showers, mirrors to get ready, hair dryers, a cardio room, changing rooms, weight machines, yoga mats, a tv, and more!  Holy crap, did I just die and go too gym-heaven!Needless to say I didn't actually make it out of the Women's locker room to see the rest of the building.  In my defense, I didn't really need to.  They had everything I needed right there!  What a wonderful place!  I will definitely be back!
",others
170,"First of all, the last thing I would do is rate a gym poorly for being crowded. It's obvious right away that the Dowd is a VERY popular place - for good reason. Although parking came be very limited, arriving with that expectation makes coming here at 5:30pm every other day much easier to swallow. This gym is flat out awesome. Many different rooms, great free weight area, great nautilus section, hybrid machine section, etc.But, the best part about the Dowd, for me, is the lengthy class schedule. Every day of the week, many throughout the day, and very accommodating to different sections of the body. Spin classes are awesome, just make sure to sign up for a bike early - they will and always do fill up. Convenient location on Morehead, close to many other parks in the area, and pretty easy to get in and out of. Overall, I love it here and couldn't recommend it enough!

171,"I recently visited this facility visiting Charlotte, NC. One note, I'm not sure why they have this 301 S. College st. address unless it's for mailing purposes only, because they is nothing that a new, unfamiliar visitor can use knowing this address that will help you find this Bat Cave. The address on the outside of the building says something TOTALLY different, and unrelated to '301' 'College' or 'St'. But, after calling the staff help me via telephone to find their location. I was very impressed with the facility and its cleanliness. All cardio equipment has there own cleaning spray and towels, which is very convenient, in that you don't have to walk all around trying to find out where the cleaning materials are located. I also took the Body Pump class with Sue M. and another young lady. The class was great and I'd suggest others to take it as well.Also, I got a chance to watch the Zumba class (instructor by Ms. B (*I can't remember her name at the moment))..but it looked very entertaining to say the least.Great job to the staff I'll definitely recommend this facility and will consider returning to it on my next Charlotte, NC visit.

172,"I was staying at the Hilton next door and got access to the YMCA.  Nice!  One of the days, I woke up with a sore throat.  Headed to the gym anyways, but started coughing horribly just as I checked in.  Had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine.  The lady at the front desk was so nice!  She brought me a cup of water because she noticed that I was coughing so much earlier.  Amazing service!  Now I wish I belonged to a YMCA back home.  Going to have to look into it for sure.

173,"I prefer CK YMCA to Dowd during the week. For one thing, it's less crowded. I also feel that people are a bit more ""real"" at CK... I don't feel underdressed when I'm working out and people actually talk to you -whereas at Dowd I feel a bit inferior because I don't own any Lululemon & I actually take my makeup off before working out. Don't get me wrong, there are some great people at Dowd & you'll find me there most Sundays -but for a middle class person that works in uptown, I find CK way more welcoming & a better workout environment than Dowd during the work week.

But so far, I like what I see and I see myself being a regular here.I was familiar with Neos because of the funny radio commercials I heard on KissFM while driving to work.  I now have Sirius because the repeated Shane Company diamond commercials where causing me to bang my head into the dash board so often that it was creating a large dent.  But the Neos commercials were short, witty and appreciated.  However - this is the not the same Neos that you may be familiar with. This new Neos Medspa is under new ownership and management.  I was a little surprised with the small size of the new medspa, but I was also a little relieved.  I was always hesitant about certain procedures because you have to leave most of your modesty at the door and I am a rather modest person.  But the small staff (who are also the owners), and homely office, felt warming and welcoming.  It was definitely less intimidating than other medspas I have considered in the past.Neos was very honest and straightforward with me, they did not try to sell me any product or convince me I needed anything extra. I am easily influenced when it comes to buying things, so this is something appreciated more so by my husband.Since I have Sirius, I don't know if the new Neos Medspa has radio commercials or if they will have the same comical flair, but as long as Tom Shane is not involved, it won't be the most annoying thing on the radio.  If he is involved, I will be doing a review update.

183,"I started going to Rejuvena since 2007, and regret that I have not wrote a review sooner. It was called something else at the time, but they still have the same WONDERFUL staff. I don't even use a primary care physician anymore, because I trust Dr. Jain with all of my medical concerns. Intentionally, I began going there for laser tattoo & hair removal, and eventually kept going for IV Nutrient & Detoxification Therapy. I have referred Dr. Jain to several friends who also see him regularly now. I believe in his practices so much that I even did a segment on Fox10 News. You can view the interview at this link: http:www.youtube.comwatchfeature=player_embedded&v=3XPy8Vv6y1Q I cannot go without mentioning the women of his office either. I have booked organic facials just so I could visit with Kimberly, who was my laser technician, and who I now consider a friend. Sadly, I have moved from Arizona, but I will go back to Scottsdale for work. I will most certainly schedule office visits during those times.

The Bod Pod provides so much (accurate) information about your body composition it allows nutrition and fitness experts to truly customize a program- no gimmicks or quick fixes here. I work out with my trainer 3 days a week and have seen some pretty amazing changes in my physical ability. My husband and I just finished a 4 day hike on the Inca Trail! I would highly recommend checking out all these guys have to offer.

188,"This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. My first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.

I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great. I called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly. Dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather. If you're planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.

My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. My husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!

194,"I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. The agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying andor the process that I needed to go through.Also, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.I see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. I've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore.

195,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway. What a neat place! It's a european style hotel (read very nice but smaller rooms). It used to be a monestary back in the day. Built around the turn of the century, it has neat large old molding and furnishings. Owner was very nice, offers complimentary wine in the evening and good full continental breakfast. All of that for only $135 a night! A short ride from everything. Includes free parking.

196,"I was so lucky to stumble upon the Priory! I came to Pittsburgh for a conference. The Westin at the convention center was booked, so I had to find alternative lodging and came across this place. I love this hotel.  The historic building is beautiful.  The beds are comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  They have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning.  It's near bars and restaurants, a nail salon, and a grocery store (I was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in Pennsylvania.  Luckily, you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk, which is open 24 hrs). The local pizza place delivers until 2 am.  It's walking distance to the Andy Warhol Museum.  Also, it's only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the Westin.  I paid $105night. The tv was very small and the water pressure was weak, but everything else exceeded my expectations.

197,"We love the Priory!I don't remember how we found this place, but I feel so lucky we did.  A beautiful restoration of a lovely old building, the Priory is a comfortable, tasteful, beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city.

198,"One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!This is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!

199,"We've stayed here twice during recent trips to Pittsburgh, and while the city itself is a bit hit and miss, the Priory is always comfortable and welcoming. A great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up Pittsburgh.Each room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town.

200,"Stayed here for several days during a very rainy time. The hotel is great, very charming, and fun to stay at. Definitely not your typical chain hotel, as it's an old-style mansion.The continental breakfast was delicious, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the amenities were wonderful (fast wifi!!). Like others said, it felt more like you were part of a fun community due to the interactions with the staff, the small great bar downstairs, and the welcoming atmosphere. The fitness center was well equipped as well, and there was a great complimentary shuttle. The driver would not only take us to restaurants, but would suggest other cool places to visit. Overall I could not recommend this more. The only ""negative"" is the area where it is doesn't have many other fun places - but they ARE a short drive away.

Two words: FREE SHUTTLE. Hell yes, free shuttle to and from the Pittsburgh Steelers game(downtown Pittsburgh Hilton, about 1 mile away). Free shuttle to and from the airport. Complimentary managers happy hour (two free drinks per person). Complementary Internet and parking. Breakfast buffet in the morning. Seriously, as a tourist on my first trip to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game this hotel made everything way to damn easy. It isn't 5 stars for it's glitz and glamour, however the rooms are clean and I cannot stress how tremendously friendly the staff is. It isn't exactly close to the downtown area, but like I said- free shuttles will take you there and pick you up. I can't recommend this place enough for it's 'value to complimentary services' ratio. Made my trip to Pittsburgh a breeze.

Only stayed for one night, but wouldn't have minded staying for more.Oh yeah, complimentary breakfast (which I didn't wake up for), happy hour (which I wasn't in the hotel for) and indoor heated pool (which I didn't get to go in).p.s. tip the shuttle driver, people.

This place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that I'm used to in Southern CA. Shadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows. Always good vibes at Shadow!

212,"As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronichiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVAShadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.  Can't visit Pittsburgh without stopping by Shadow Lounge.

The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book! It shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question! The ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a Flaming Dr. Pepper.....had to bring a little Southern treasure North! ;)I love the diverse, yet open and friendly crowd each night.

Being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  But somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to Moondog's for some great live music.This is another one of those places in which I can't believe I'm the first to review.  Moondog's is a local institution, people!  It's been around here ever since I can remember.  Rusted Root played here in their pre-""Send Me On My Way"" days.It's everything you want in a small music venue.  Although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  And Moondog's brings in the music!  It has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  The Starlite Lounge Restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  It's local music folks.  Come out and support it!

I'm not sure how long the theater has been around - but I grew up here in Charlotte and never knew about it until about two years ago, when I went and saw the North Mississippi Allstars - awesome show. I'm home for  the holidays right now and I just saw  Acoustic Syndicate, also a great show! Fantastic sound and a huge - and very accessable - bar. No smoking (or at least the night I was there), but there's a back area when smokers can go. Overall a really cool spot, I'm so happy that Charlotte's got a good music venue- woo hoo!

222,"I get warm fuzzies just thinking about the Visulite.  It's cool, laid-back, and almost feels like you have stepped into a time warp....like some sort of dimly lit lounge from the '50's.  The first place I ever saw a concert in Charlotte and I was hooked.  The prices are standard bar, slightly overpriced with teeny tiny cups for mixed drinks.  But, if the band you are seeing rocks, then it's all good.  Sounds quality is excellent and can be LOUD!!!

224,"I need to come here again soon, it is a really dark, tight atmosphere where you can get up close and personal with the acts.  The employees are very into the music as well, which is always a plus.  I hate going to really mainstream venues where the security and bartenders just blankly stare at the guests.  These guys are nodding along to the tunes and thoroughly feeling the grooves.  Someone told me that this place used to be a porn studio back in the 70's, this may be one of those city myths, but it looks like it could have been.  It would be pretty rock and roll if that were the case.  Anyways, I am a huge fan of the Visulite.

228,"As far as live music venues go in Charlotte, this is my favorite and I've been to pretty much all of them.  It's not a big venue, but they get some decent acts for my music taste (JamFunkElectronica).Cover charges are usually around $10-15, extremely cheap (Obviously also depends on the artist....).  They also have both beer and liquor.  It's nice to have the option, some nights I just want to let it all out.  The beer selection is good as they have about 10-12 taps with local NC brews and the likes of Magic Hat, Sweetwater, New Belgium, etc.  They also have a good bottle selection for the stuff that's a little more rare.  Drinks are normal, reasonable prices.As far as the musiclayout is concerned, there really isn't a bad spot in the place.  It's multi-tiered, so lots of areas with a good view.  The barentrance is at the top, then it drops down to an open area with the sound board and cocktail tables (it's nice to have the option to sit and enjoy the music), and then drops down again to a pit area that's standing room only in front of the stage.  The stage is the height of the 2nd level with the cocktail tables, so that's usually where I'm at, but people are always getting down in the pit.  All in all, the layout of the place is why I like it so much.  The sound is great too.  You can't have a great music venue without great acoustics!  I always look forward to a show here.
",others
229,"Great Jazz and they even let people stand in.  Some high schooler was amazing on the harmonica.  As a big Slim Harpo fan I was very impressed.  The scene wasn't smoky at all.  Very nice although the crowd was small.
",others
230,"I wish I had made it out to this place on my last trip to Charlotte. Pretty much all of the other music venues I wanted to visit reserve their acts for Friday and Saturday nights (especially on a holiday weekend like Thanksgiving). However, I'm more of a middle-of-the-week music appreciator. For other Monday night music lovers, this is an excellent place to take a visitor for some straight ahead jazz and blues. I used to love standing in line in the cold to see jazz played the way its meant to be played, in a smoky basement with singers and musicians jumping on the mic at completely unscheduled times, at a little club called Small's in Manhattan's West Village. And the ability to enjoy some of the best Rockabilly, Country, and Blues musicians around (for FREE!) at Rodeo Bar in Manhattan's Murray Hill any night of the week, has also spoiled me.My point being - places like Small's, Rodeo Bar, and Double Door Inn are a dying breed. It is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal, and velvet-rope-free. Though I doubt that the Double Door can draw New York sized crowds on a ""school night"", if you bring a group of friends here now, it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to come.
",others
231,"One of the best places in Charlotte for continual live music. Open since the mid-70s the Double Door inn has hosted a ton of top acts and is always full of people who love music. Charlotte isn't known nationally for its music scene but with venues like this, it is hard to deny that you can't have a great time with Charlotte music. Decent beer selection and regular visits from the legendary Bill Hanna (at least legendary for Double Door Inn visitors) solidify the Inn as a location for musical bliss any night of the week.
",others
232,"My dad was a bouncer here in the 70's and my first visit was with the old man. I couldn't imagine any better venue in Charlotte. They even had a live band on Christmas night the last time I was in town. Can't say enough, so I'll leave it at that.

This venue has been around forever and you can really tell....it's oozing with history from the pictures on the walls to the original bar.  There is always something going on at the Double Door, every night of the week and many, many famous faces have graced their stage including slow hand himself, Eric Clapton.  The bartenders are friendly, will gladly serve you PBR in a can, and may even ring the bell up front for a good tip.  Oh and you can buy scratchers tickets at the bar if you are bored with the band.  :)

Crawling with history, and plenty of stickers on every surface from showsbands of the past, this hole-in-the-wall turned landmark is one my favorite venues in the QC. I've been here on multiple occasions and each time has been different and more memorable than the last. My first impression, a while back, was a little disheartening from how many people were smoking inside. Now, so I hear, this has been done away with. Good for us non-smokers and maybe a blow to the cigarette-goers. However, this paled to the happiness I found in the small bar with cheap PBR and the even tinier stage. I've seen this stage packed with 6 member outfits with hardly enough room to play and smaller rockabilly bands tearing it up! So much personality there could be a novella written about the days it has seen. Goodness what a cool joint. This place isn't glamorous, folks. It's an old, converted house, turned-venue. If you're into punk, metal, or anything in between, check their website. Always booking shows and plenty of variety. You can buy tickets online or pay at the door. Beware on rainy nights. The parking lot, if you can call it a parking lot haha, gets really muddy. Park on the street to avoid a muddy car! Or, be awesome and park in the mud and make it a story! Cheers to the Milestone and many years to come of kicking some serious rock ass!

243,"Great location, best to go with nice weather because the atmosphere is all about being outside.Never a better time to go get a bottle of wine, relax outside in the nice weather, and listen to some music or catch up with friends.  Wine in all categories, under 20, over 50, take your pick because there is something there for you.If you're not in the mood for wine, don't be scared - there's a pretty nice beer selection as well.  For only 4 refrigerators they fit a lot of options inside.

244,"It's really a shame people in Charlotte don't use Yelp very much yet, because this place definitely deserves its props as the best wine bar  shop in the area. No matter what you're interested in, if you want to have a drink the guys and girls here can help you find the perfect match for your palate. The wine selection is hard to beat, and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in Charlotte. The beer selection is also top notch, and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample from.One of the best things about the Wine Vault, and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre, are their weekly tastings. For $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines, and learn a little bit about each one while you do it. There's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting, so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people. There's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the Vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine, in addition to a much larger seating area that I think most people don't even realize exists. They do lots of private events down in the main cellar room, so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long time.My favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area. They are always extremely reasonable in price, especially when you compare it to similar offerings around town. Make sure you get on the mailing list, because you definitely want to sign up for these early before they get sold out!

245,"I can't believe I never reviewed this one before.  A very classy but casual spot in the university area.  Amazing wine and beer selection.  Good cheeses, live music, outdoor patio(where you can bring you dog).  All of this right by the lake.  These guys also schedule tastings and pairings at some local restaurants.  Ranging from (25-80)ish per person, it is well worth it.  I highly recommend this place for a casual after dinner date spot or a gathering of friends.

246,"This is the gem of University City. It's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot, with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses. At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. It's commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. The Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. It's worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers. If you're single, the last one is especially fun.

248,"I absolutely love this little hang out. This is the best place in the area (and among my top pics in the city) for a casual date with friends. The prices are reasonable, the live music is fun, and the dogs are cute. The atmosphere of the Wine Vault is always nice regardless of what you're looking for. If you're in the mood for a little revelry with whoever may be passing by, grab a table close to the center. If a little more room to breath and a little less volume is what you are after, just grab a table around the outer edges.I have to admit that this place doesn't come to mind too much during the winter; but every summer the Wine Vault manages to stay on my ever-changing list of places that I want to be.

249,"I....am a wine snob. So having said that, I love this little wine boutique. Very comfortable and inviting interior. Comfortable patio area for nice days. A very good selection of wines from all price and taste ranges. Daily varied offerings of wine by the glass or you can hunt through their wine walls for a bottle of your choosing. A little chilled something available for the beer and bubbly drinkers. Great location and atmosphere.

251,"I cannot believe there are not over 100 reviews for this place raving about how it's such an awesome hang out.  Whenever I'm looking for a place to hang out with my friends and catch up, the wine vault always comes to mind FIRST.  It's usually difficult to catch an open table, but once you do, it's worth it.  You can buy a bottle of wine or a good beer and sit & sip outside (or inside) until your heart is content.  They do have a good selection of wine & beer, so you're not always (forced to be) drinking the same thing.**Another bonus: Dog FriendlinessIf you have a dog, heshe is welcome to hang out amongst the peoples.  Odds are that there will be at least half a dozen other poochies looking to mingle just like their owners.  **Something I'd like to see wine vault do:  set up easy recycling
",others
252,"Super cool! We happened upon the wine vault while in Charlotte apartment hunting. Coming from Jacksonville, FL, we've never seen anything quite like this. You just go in, pick a wine and find a table to settle in and relax. Its a good, inexpensive way to try new wines.We'll be regulars after moving to Charlotte!

253,"The Inferno plays goth, industrial, etc music.  Great place to go and dance, and there's plenty of eye candy.  Wednesday nights are nice and small, and Leather and Lace is good if you like dancing around a lot of people.  Sabbat de Sade is fun for public BDSM. Sometimes there are cool live bands.
",others
254,"First time here was Leather and Lace night in Oct. 2009. Finally an adult place to have adult fun. Not a bunch of college kids goofing around and giggling like fetish night at The Cardinal. This was much more mature and so much fun! Everyone friendly. So many beautiful sexy people. Loved the guy in the mesh shirt, hee hee! Ended up getting quite naughty and I cannot wait to return. I thought it was much larger than I expected, with the dance floor in the front, the middle area bar, and then the whole area in the back with two more bars there.Finally I have a place to go play!Kissy

The place is very stylish with great color scheme. The bartenders are very knowledgeable on drinks and friendly and quick. The prices are moderate for drinks. Easy to get to. Easy parking. It seemed very friendly and inviting both times. To bad the inferno isnt in my neighborhood! :)

258,"Decent cover charge, $8. Spacious. VERY good House music. No creepers. My girlfriend and I visited last night and we had a BLAST. Non-stop dancing for 2-hours because the music that THAT good and engaging; I had to force myself to take a break. I love to dance and to have a good time. We were both able to do this without being bothered by anyone and with enough space to do to so. We did not have drinks, so I can't offer any opinions on that. After a 4 hour drive from Chicago, on the same day, this was a GREAT place to end up on a whim. If you seek a clean good time with good music and lots of dancing, then the Inferno is the place to be. It was cozy. NB: No coat check, but it was not crowded so placing our coats on the seats and keeping an eye from the dance floor was not an issue. Happy dancing YAW!

259,"I haven't been here too many times, but the place is great! It has a really nice atmosphere and looks a lot nicer than the clubs I've been to before. The floors weren't sticky and overall the place was actually really clean. I really wasn't expecting that especially since I went to one of the fetish nights. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting. I guess that's probably the difference between clubs in smaller cities and big cities. It's not that big of a deal to me, but I imagine they can't hold a really big crowd. The drinks are fairly strong and aren't too expensive. The bathrooms are very clean and well lit. The staff are all amazingly nice and friendly. I enjoyed taking a drink outside to the smoking area and chatting. The people I met were lovely and I'm excited to meet new people at future events!

260,"My favorite venue in CU.Affordable tickets.Excellent sound.Easy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the ""center"" wall. And cheap drinks.Having been to venues all over the Midwest, I always find myself wanting to be at the Highdive for a show.  Especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in Chicago might just reach capacity down in Champaign.How I miss it.

261,"I've never been here for a show...well, let me clarify.I used to come here tons as an undergrad for various Asian parties, and I still come here most times I've visited as an undergrad.  Things usually devolve into a shit show.Which, honestly, is a good thing, and it's what I'm shooting for when I want to forget about the real world for a weekend.  Sure, it's off campus, but it does have a giant dance floorstage and some awesome people behind the bar. Last time I was here I just kept asking for either A) something awesome or B) something alcoholic.  Never was disappointed once.If anyone you know is planning a party at the HD, be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up. You won't regret it (and you might not remember it).

Parking was a breeze, we found plenty of spaces on a Saturday night right in front of the venue.If you're coming to a show, get there early to snag seating.  We found great seats up in balcony, which had it's own bar.  Were the bar stools and benches comfortable  Hell no.  Not at all, but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns.  Maybe it's because I'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink, but $4.50 Wild Turkey mixers made for a great night!  Service was quick, and I never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was nice.All in all, a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music.
",others
264,"Folks, this is your quintessential small town concert venue.  Great prices, great service, great music.  I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  What I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.  I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy.  Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.

265,"I am rating the food aspect of Cowboy Monkey 5 stars, because you would be hard-pressed to find a better plate of nachos anywhere. For the Cowboy Nachos alone, which are a bed of chips topped with tomatoes, guacamole, white cheese sauce, jalapeno peppers, and cilantro chicken (optional), I would swim across the ocean to let this savory swell of heaven crash against my taste buds! The food here is excellent. Though it is on the pricey side, when the patio and kitchen are open during the warm months, it is worth celebrating. Sadly, Cowboy Monkey does not serve their tasty Tex-Mex fare during winter or early spring. They open just in time for EbertFest at the end of April. If you like Americanized Mexican food, do yourself a favor and check this place out.

269,"So you wonder, (as you wander) does Phoenix have any history that pre-dates 1911 What happened to all the old brick and western style buildings that housed, cotton, supplies, cactus jelly, or whatever Phoenix would have had stored in a warehouse in 1911  Well this is a place that has history (albeit, only 80 years or so, but hey we'll take it.) Coming from Boston, I yearn to have some kind of architectural history, buildings that have meaning, purpose,  character. I mean how many adobe style, clay shingled buildings can we have seriously So if your looking for cool atmosphere, a safe venue (well lite parking lots) and great music, check out the brick house. I saw Okkerivil River here, and the experience was great, and the venue is the perfect size for a small show. They serve a wide range of beer and drinks. (food too) My only complaint, it was pretty hot inside, but then again it's ALWAYS hot inside buildings here in September. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.

270,"I lived a good 4 blocks from La Feria during grad school and loved every second of it. Yes, Pamela's is downstairs and, if you can avoid drooling at the thought of chocolate chip banana pancakes, crepe style you can enjoy the best of peruvian food- pumpkin, peanut, and sweet savory tastes. You can get meat, vegetarian or a combo of both (which is always what I ended up with). Delish salad to accompany and bread to take those last swipes of sauce off your plate. Everything is great with an Inca Kola- and maybe even better with the Peruvian mirror you've been eying up on the wall.Oh, and they do TO GO, which saved me on my walk home from the bus!

I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front.

272,"This place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches.  Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  They serve these with rice and side salad.  My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato, cheese, and pea casserole.  They also make a great egg salad sandwich with guacamole.  The homemade sweet potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves.

273,"This delicious Peruvian Restaurant is often overlooked due to its location over the wildly popular Pamela's restaurant.  For those who don't want to wait in line for Pamela's or those who are looking for a great bite to eat, LaFeria is the place for you.  All of the food I've tried there has been great.  Their daily specials are usually yummy and their empanadas and sandwiches are great.  I especially love their salad.  Turkey breast over a bed of greens with red onions, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese dress in a tasty vinegarette.  It's light, yet you wont leave hungry.  While you're there, check out the Peruvian arts and crafts  that are also for sale there.

I can't comment on how closely they adhere to Peruvian cuisine, because I've never had it before.  The shop is fun too, but I'd feel awkward browsing the art without intending to stay, so I only look around after I'm done eating.

The classics are still on the menu (like the delicious ropa vieja) but now it's expanded to include things like their cheese and potato stew. As you'd expect, everything is delicious. It's also worth noting that the service is quick and friendly and there's a whole section where you can shopperuse Peruvian folk art and goods while you wait for your food. What can I say I love La Feria.

Well, La Feria is the clear exception. For $15 (or less) you can have an amazing Peruvian meal. My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism (I know, we're missing out on a lot of yummy meals!), and La Feria is particularly great for us. They always have 2 veggie specials that are great.

I wasn't feeling too great so I just ordered the three empanada platter and split it with my boyfriend. I picked the eggcream cheesegreen onion, spicy apple, and beef empanadas.

Their Mojitos and Caipirinhas are the very best in town...dinner seemed a bit overpriced, but the food is still excellent.

281,"Yum yum yum!!! LaTorre's is one of my favorite lunch spots and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been!  My personal fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries.  Their food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad either.I have a slight issue with LaTorre's and here it is:  Once upon a time, I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard.  Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way.  Hmm...pre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  I'm a skeptic.  After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!  By the way, my spy happens to be an employee so I know it's true.  All in all, this place is great.

282,"The food is good, but to me, the desserts are what really make Latorre's special. They do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magical.They have great lunch specials. It's a little pricey for just me, but it's just right for a business lunch with a client. It makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and fun.There's lots of vegetarian options, which is always a good thing. Everything is presented beautifully, which is always fun. Some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat. Salsa night is also a good time. The crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself. I've honestly never had a bad time here, night or day. Charlotte needs more places with so much character.

283,"Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).

I had papusas and a random sampler - and my favorite fried plantain with beans and sour cream. This was good - better than Eliana's yes - but both are pretty damn good. And i felt like this place was Phoenix - super seedy exterior, lots of espanol, and good food in a strip mall - Phoenix to a tee.

286,"A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas. I got  a massive plate of those crispy, delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata, which could have been a meal in itself. Our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide. We left stuffed and satisfied.

287,"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell Where has this been my whole life"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.

You have to park in the back and at first glance you may question yourself for choosing this place.  But it really is worth it.  Once you get inside the place is spotless.  Very well kept.  The menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises.  I got the Carne Asada plate.  The steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It came with yellow rice, beans, a salad, and tortillas.  The tortillas were thick and grilled.  I also shared a bean and cheese papusa.  The papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese.  You have to try it.  Our meal came with chips and salsa and a salvadorian slaw mixture to share.  The price was right and the staff is friendly food A++++++++Good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed.

Its clean, comfortable and charming;  the menu is varied, with foods from El Salvador, Mexico, the Caribbean and even a few american style items.  The service is friendly, helpful, and didn't try to hurry us up.  My husband had the steak and onions, and it was excellent. We all shared several pupusas, which everyone loved.  And shared a fried plantain with beans and cream and it was delicious!  My vegitarian friend had the Fried Yuca (wout the pork), and she loved it. My husband is puerto rican and is very picky about restaurants, and had been resistant to trying Salvadorean food for a while - but this is now one of his favorite new hole-in the walls in Phoenix. We will be going back often!

293,"I love, love, love Eliana's. I have been eating here for years and enjoy bringing people new to Salvadoran food. The interior is cheerfully decorated with colorful folk art, and the service is always swift and friendly. My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas, kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita, fried yucca plant (very starchy, like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink, a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream, a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods, but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.Eliana's is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience. Everyone can find something they'll like- low spiciness, but full of great flavors and textures.

294,"Delicious. Had papusas and some other things selected at random off of the menu. All delicious. Also shared their fried plantain with beans and sour cream. Heaven.This place is wonderful and delicious. And totally reasonably priced.

295,"OMGS you guys. This is a little diamond in the rough. Nice and cheap, with a modest, but DELICIOUS, menu. I share the combo platter with my BF and then usually get the chicken, which is so moist and tender and slathered in creme...And it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-sauce.Papusas.  Need I say more
",others
296,"Having passed this place more than once while driving around, I'd always wanted to stop by but never made it much of a priority. Well I stumbled across reviews here and due to the raving about the papusas I HAD to stop in.My partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon, mmm pupusa bandwagon (drools). We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa. I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.The appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.Sidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in. Oh, and the tortillas are Salvadorian style meaning thick and sort of along the lines of a Mexican gordita, I could eat these for days.Pupusas (drools) ""give me a towel boy"" (drools)
",others
297,"Very Cute and Cozy Place! The Food was AMAZING! Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!
",others
298,"A friend of mine told me of Eliana's because I was familiar with Salvadoran food from L.A. and lamented that I couldn't find a good place in Phoenix.  I was happily surprised to find the food as good as it was there.That was in 1998.  I come here every so often when I get a ""hankering"" for Pupusas and have become very familiar with the proprietor and his family.  AWESOME food, AWESOME service, AWESOME ambience!
",others
299,"OK, I'll start with a disclaimer, I absolutely adore the people that run this restaurant and have been going to their restaurant since I moved to Phoenix around '91 (two locations ago).However, I have taken countless people to try the food from my native country and EVERYONE has LOVED it.   From my vegetarian to foodie (or chowhound) friends have found something (usually more) that keeps them coming back. Many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant. My favorite is the Mojarra Frita becaus it brings back memories of growing up in beautiful El Salvador.  I recommend the Especial Combinacion de Eliana's for first time visitors -- it has a Salvadorean tamale wrapped in banana leaf and is moist like a mousse; the tradtional pupusa and a savory turnover called Pasteles ($6).  For a hearty meal, the I recommend the Bistec (beef)  or Pollo (chicken) dishes that come with salad, rice, beans and Salvadorean tortillas ($8.95)..After reading some of the reviews, I just liked to say, thank you for trying out this food but it is not Mexican food.  I can recommend some of those if you msg me

300,"We ate at Eliana's based on reviews we had read.  Since we had to be at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport anyway, and, Eliana's was not far from the airport, we decided to have lunch.  It was wonderful and we highly recommend it.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  There were 3 of us and we each had something different.  Every dish was fresh and flavorful.  The juice drinks (I wish I could remember the names) were very good.  We will definitely go back.

301,"Love this place. Service is always excellent-- it's usually the owner that waits on you. The food is wonderfully flavorful without using a lot of spice. Natural flavors are what makes this place tick.I've eaten here many times, and my recommendation is that you just order every appetizer on the menu and forget the entrees. At least, the first time you go anyway... You'll want to try it all.Very good food!

303,"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.I can't recommend this place enough!

",others
305,"Initially I went to this place for the tamales which were recommended by a coworker who is from El Salvador. Someof the people in my office also said that they were amazing (and I trust their opinions).  So I went in looking forward to that and ended up ordering all the pupusas as well. I must say I'm not a big fan of the tamales, they are too moist for my taste. The banana leaves do give a great flavor though. The true stars are the pupusas, which I had never had before and have since become addicted too. I literally order at least 6 for myself every time I go now. They are asininely delicious!!! I grab a large bite of pupusa and some of the curtido (a kind of slaw-ish awesomeness) and just chow down. Beware the post-lunch coma though as eating that many will knock the average person on their ass. This brings me to my one bone to pick with this stripmall gem, their coffee sucks! I was expecting super-strong coffee with mud at the bottom when I ordered the cafe listo but it tasted like gas station coffee. They didn't even have any milk, just powdered non-dairy nonsense...I'm already a diehard fan but if they stepped up the coffee I would pretty much call it my mecca. This is the kind of food that makes all seem right with the world...Holy Shit!!! I almost forgot about the ceviche! It's a little pricey but it is soooo worth it. I split it with one of my people at work and ended up sharing it with the whole office......very much against my will. People thought it looked so good they just kept poaching forkfulls off my plate. Definietly a must have dish
",others
306,"Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back.
",others
307,"YES! Thank you Salvadoreno for making my pupusa loving dreams come true! I just moved back to the valley after 6yrs away, having discovered and fallen in love with El Salvadorian food in the mean while. I was worried that I wouldn't find a good spot here as we some times lack in fine ethnic cuisine that isn't Mexican. I was tickled pink last night to discover Salvadoreno in an unassuming strip mall in Mesa (they have 2 other locations around the valley). The food was blissfully authentic as was the price. They even suggested a deal on the menu for 20 pupusas for $30. I might add this place to my bi-weekly grocery shopping list. I can't say enough about how happy I was to get real El Salvadorian food that hadn't been taken over by the flavors of Mexico, U.S. or Arizona. One of the family members who runs the joints was even there and everyone who worked there was quite friendly. I'm happy to support these guys. I will definitely be returning.

308,"Papusas!  This is one of the few places that I actually have cravings for.  You can't go wrong with any of the papusa flavors (carne asada is my favorite followed by loroco flower) and the fried plantains are an excellent treat.  Eat the papusas topped with the curtido (coleslaw) and salsa, it really pushes the flavor over the top.

I may be a bit biased because I studied in Costa Rica in college for a few months, so I love any latin american and carribean comfort food because it brings back great memories.We shared the platanos maduros and mofongo as appetizers and some mojitos to drink. The mofongo did not sound great to me when I looked at the menu description, but it was amazing. The platanos were great too. I had the pumpkin bisque, which was sweet, salty, creamy and delicious, and some rice and beans. My husband had a pulled pork dish which was also good, and we had some lime pie for dessert. Next time I would order  a little less food,but I am glad we could try each dish - everything was good. We will be back!

323,"My sisters columbian friend pointed us in this direction. I enjoyed this new ethnic experience. The moment I walked in, I was reminded of my my aunty's old restaurant shop. I do mean to say ""restaurant shop"" because that's exactly what it is. a restaurant and shelves of snacks, toys and other take-home things. I guess that's one reason why I love this place, for taking me back to a childhood I almost forgot.I've never been to any other columbian eatery, but word is that the portions are huge. Which they were.. for me and my sister anyway. We shared this plate of ""Tamal"" which came with a side of rice. By the way, the rice was surprisingly sweet. Almost like sticky rice. It really complimented the spices in the tamal. I've also discovered the best made empanadas ever! probably even better than filipino empanadas =X. It's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside. And what set it in stone for me was the ajiahjiahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) sauce.That place brought together family. Mainly because we realized we were sitting next to the family of my sisters friend. They also have a huge extended area. Cus the area we were in was the ""restaurant shop"" But the other side is specifically restaurant. It's good for big groups and such. Cus yeah, I'm all about rolling deep! I'll take my friends anywhere we can fit.

328,"Hands down still my favorite place to come for pupusas in town. This location has recently remodeled inside and it gives it a nice friendly face lift. The pupusas are always so hot and fresh and always cooked perfectly. Not oily, or too much masa and not enough filling. The curtido here is always crunchy and delicious. Never too salty or vinegary. I also love the variety of fillings they have at this location for pupusas. Chicharrones and cheese is one my favorites but the calabasas and cheese is definitely in my rotation now. I recently had the yucca and fried chicharrone and while it was not as delicious as my pupusas, it was good. The fried pork was definitely fried as it was super crispy and once I added some salt and tomato sauce it was good eats. The yucca was perfect. Soft and creamy on the inside and a nice bite on the outside.Helpful Hint: Call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait long for your food.  Also know that they charge $1.00 to use your debit.

My hair is very fine and I don't have a whole lot of it, but Sue does wonders with it, especially with my latest cut. I never wanted it shorter than shoulder length, but decided recently to make a change. Because I'm getting older, and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive, or didn't work,  I wanted to try a shorter cut. The cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker. I have had several compliments on the cut, one from another hairstylist who worked at Regis. Sue is also reasonable, charging $80 for my cut and hi-lights. I will admit that I had to wait outside the salon once when I was the first customer of the day, but that was once in over 5 years.

357,"On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, ""There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there"" Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about itLet's go in order of importance:Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, ""we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!"" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.

358,"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. They have a small menu of localfresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - ""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different."" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the ""main drag"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.

359,"Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).- free wifi- outside tables- tasty treats- they have a blog!- really great coffee- the staff are coffee experts

360,"Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do love their iced mochas!  They have wonderful teas, cider, hot chocolate.  The servers are wonderful and the brownies, as big as your head, are like crack.  Amy, the owner, has created a wonderful place for community.
",others
361,"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.

The employees are awesome.The owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.

367,"Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh  YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decorCons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just meHi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me  Yeah!I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.
",others
368,"I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing hereThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.
",others
369,"It's all about the Black & Gold. (Only on the brunch menu now, though!)And the Tofu Tenders.And the vegan baked goods from My Goodies.My only complaint is regarding the vegan milkshakes. Sorbet does not a milkshake make.
",others
370,"I looove Quiet Storm! It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. Quiet Storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well!
",others
371,"I'm not sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place! Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the ""Maelstrom"" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not disappointed by the Quiet Storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.
",others
372,"This is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on Pittsburgh's east end.  It is also a haven for the veganvegetarian hipster.  I've been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasn't happy with.  Prices are reasonable, maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  Keeping this place open is well worth that cost.If you aren't feeling so hungry, this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid.  Check out the milkshakes!
",others
373,"CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffeediner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.
",others
374,"Quiet Storm was the other bookend to my trip to Pittsburgh, providing a perfect balance with Zenith earlier in the week. It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. All in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.

He was patient and stated ""take your time, no hurry"". He offered me suggestions. We even discussed shoes for a brief minute, very personable. The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese. I ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes. The food came out QUICK, like 5 minutes and everything was fresh and great. Did I mention this also came with soup I paid $13 total for my meal and a cold chai. Could not ask for more. My only and I mean only complaint is that they only serve lunch at lunch time, the only serve dinner at dinner time, etc..so be mindful of the time of day you go....

Totally comfortable location, somewhat friendly associates, no fireplace anymore but I can overlook that. Lots of comfy leather chairs, you feel totally at home here.

Becky always remembers my orders and Astrid makes my iced coffee just right. I could sit in there for hours and I often do.

I spent my whole college life and a little bit after serving up Market Square's best coffee, tea and assorted goodies!I know I'm totally biased but I really do feel like this is the best Starbucks in the city!  No other store has such a cozy feel to it.  I may have fallen asleep in the big comfy chairs by the fireplace a couple times.  I mean, it was hard slingin coffee all day!  Especially when you have to get up at 5 AM to be there at 5:30 AM (yeah, I totally rolled out of bed to go to work).  It gets SLAMMED around 6:30 or 7 with the before work crowd.  I can still remember people's faces and what they ordered.  I could never understand the woman who ordered a Venti (large) 8 pump white chocolate mocha with whip EVERY morning.  I guess girl needed her sugar to survive in the AM.  The nice thing is they're ALWAYS open.  Much to the chagrin of me and my coworkers with the madness of LIght Up NIght and St. Patrick's day drunken festivities.  But it's nice for the tourists to stop in and grab a quick drink and some advice on where to go downtown on a Saturday morning.  I'm thankful now when I'm downtown on a Sunday because I know it's one of the ONLY places open!  It's just a really great place to meet a friend to catch up or sit and study.  Plus they offer free wi-fi, which is always a plus!Just remember, Barista's are people too!!  Grunting out ""tall coffee"" instead of a hello doesn't usually fly as a good greeting.  Cheer up, you're getting caffeine soon!

And if you do have a good friend or relative who loves coffee, this is the best place to get a distinctive gift for that person.Nicholas Coffee Company has been around a long time, since 1919 actually.  One  thing that makes their coffee so good is that they roast them on the premises.  You can really taste the difference versus getting bulk coffee at Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts.  Some of my favorite blends include the Ethiopian Harrar, Costa Rican Tarrazu, and if in the mood for something a little stronger and darker, I recommend the French Roast.  They have their private blends too.I'm not into tea as much, although I'll buy here in the summer to make ice tea.  And they do sell Chinese Restaurant tea, which Rick and I love to brew when we order Chinese take-out.  They also have a lot of boxed teas and gift teas for the tea lover in your life.  Want to know what ""China Gunpowder Temple of Heaven"" is  http:www.nicholascoffee.netwebstorestorefrontItemBuy.cfmItemID=451They also have a lot of teapots and coffee makers if you are looking for a nice gift for someone.

One last thing, their website http:www.nicholascoffee.netwebstorestorefrontstoremain.cfmCFID=4407284&CFTOKEN=92186416 is very good and it has a lot of good tips on brewing good coffee and tea.

I buy a coffee to drink as I shop, a few bags in bulk for family members, and a ton of smaller bags for myself at work.  They even have flavored-honey filled straws for tea, cigars, and all sorts of accessories.  I love stopping here during the holiday season.  I make a huge gift basket for my parents.

Rows of specialty coffees, teas and candies line the walls  and create the feeling of a genuinely unique experience. It's got a small town feel, which is rmost efreshing! for a Downtown location. Specialty drinks are their modus operandi, like the Chocolate Banana Bread Latte, or my humour favorite: Fat Guy in a Little Coat Latte!! I have been in a number of times, both in busy rush hours and during the inbetween hours. The service has ALWAYS been friendly, efficient & creative, so don't hesitate to ask a few questions and try a new combination.

Friendly, knowledgeable staff.I usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.

Every day, they make fresh whipped cream, roasted peanuts, and peanut butter.All of the baristas are extremely friendly and helpful.

Maxwell House and Folger's are okay, but soemtimes we need a little variety.So I picked up some Olde Vienna which is a little darker than most American roasts, but not as dark as French Roast.  I also picked up a nice Kenya AA blend.  But I'm also become a tea lover and I picked up some Stash Decaffeinated Earl Grey--makes a great ice tea!  Great coffee and service here.

The flavored coffee is the BEST, one can immediately taste the difference from the brews here and the nauseating Hazelnut that is sold at every other place that sells coffee.  That flavor should be banished from the Earth, but that's another story.Try the Graham Cracker, Chocolate Orange, Almond Joy or Coconut, delicious!  Nicholas also carries freshly baked biscotti in a variety of flavors as well as other eclectic baked goods. A must stop for visiting guests and coffeetea lovers!

394,"They are in fact ""the oldest coffee store"" in Pittsburgh, being created in 1919. I wanted breakfastlunch and nothing was open in Market Square until 11am so this little place caught my eye. They don't roast, pack, or warehouse their products, but roast small batches of Arabican beans daily at optimum temperatures to insure peak flavor. Upon walking in I was greeted with the scintillating waft of fresh coffee beans. Tons of different flavors of Torani syrups also lined the walls, making my decision even that much harder. They had fancy lattes with turtle, chocolate, raspberry, etc enticing names. I decided to stick with one of their brews for the day: Southern Pecan roast and had it just black. It was quite delicious. My sister just asked for a large coffee on ice. I'm not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine. Still delicious for an iced coffee but I can't deal with those people that like their coffee in milkshake form. Upon leaving and inspecting the various bags of beans and teas I noticed this place also sells cigars! Hot dog. What a gem.

395,"This is probably the best place in Pittsburgh to get an espresso, cappucino, or latte.  It's a small, no-frills coffee company -- don't come in here asking for a soy non-fat no-whip caramel crappacino or whatever, because you will be laughed out the door.  They roast their own coffee, and you can also buy their coffee (whole bean or ground) and take it home with you to brighten your mornings.  They have a coffee-of-the-month club, which I aspire to join someday.The best time to visit La Prima is a Saturday morning in early fall.  The Strip will be in its full bustle.  Go up to the counter, try to puzzle out the Italian saying on the chalkboard while you wait, order a coffee, and sit outside at one of the iron tables.  The delicious-smelling coffee steam will waft up in the crisp morning air, old Italian men will have just started their mornings of sitting outside, smoking cigars, and making fun of each other over interminable coffees, and all will be right with the world.

In other words, the place is a charmless room awash in harsh fluorescent lights.  It has a couple of high tables but no seats (well, when the weather is good, they have outdoor seats). The regulars take their espresso standing, half chatting with each other, half watching whatever RAI programming that is showing on the TV.  In addition to the espressocappuccinolatte, I recommend the freshly squeezed juice. I don't know why, but theirs just taste better than others. I also like to get a breakfast pastry from the bakery next door.

398,"What an amazing find!  I have become so jaded in my travels with generic coffee shops pretending to be Italian because they have Italian roast coffee and a picture of the Colosseum above the register, as if that is all it takes.  No, this place is the real deal, through and through.  I really felt like I was back in Italy the moment I walked in.  Up on the TV there was an Italian football game being broadcast in Italian.  In front of me in line were a group of people discussing the merits of Lambrusco wine from Modena and how its ""Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita"" certification is reason enough not to confuse it with lesser imports marketed under the same name.  Mind you, this conversation was entirely in Italian.  Meanwhile, behind me there were some old men have an entirely different conversation in Italian.  This was by no means unique to my first visit either.  It really is a slice of Italy here!Authentic ambiance aside, the coffee is rather good too.  My only lament is that their large is not an Americanized large.  They have a pretty nice selection of bags of organic and fair trade beans should you wish to brew some at home.  Espresso  They are actually one of the wholesalers for espresso machines in the city, and they actually service the machines.  Yeah, they know what they're doing.  You really can't miss at all here.  The best part though is that this is genuinely a place where you want to hang out, relax, and socialize.  It's wonderful!

I went back here several times over a 3 day period during my visit in Pittsburgh. We stumbled across this cute Italian coffee shop on our way to watch the runners at the Pittsburgh Marathon. I needed coffee and I needed it now. This was the first place I saw.  To my amazement, the coffee was probably some of the best I've had. I kid you not.  I did not have to put anything in it (I did add some cinnamon though).  It is fantastic!  Perfectly brewed to perfection.  I even bought a bag of beans of La Prima's own Grow Pittsburgh brand bold flavor that they have made locally. It's delicious!This is a really authentic Italian coffee shop attached to a bakery and a wonderful find right off ""The Strip"" in Downtown Pittsburgh.

400,"I'm rarely blown away by coffee.  I mean, McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts make some reasonably tasty coffee at very affordable prices.  I've never been a fan of Starbucks, too bitter and expensive.  But when I can I will frequent local coffee shops looking for something amazing.  Well La Prima is that something amazing.I first encountered their coffee at Coca Cafe.  I don't usually taste coffee and say, ""Wow, that coffee is really good!""  But on the occasion where I first tasted La Prima, that's exactly what I said.  That was months ago and I don't know why it took me so long to make it down to their shop in the Strip.  Perhaps because it is the summer and one of the last things on my mind during this time is hot beverages.  Now every time I brew some of those fresh beans, I feel like I'm treating myself and I enjoy the taste of just the coffee without adding sugar andor cream. It's a very welcoming place if not a bit overwhelming with all the choices.  But if you're in the Strip and looking for a good cup of coffee, La Prima Espresso Company is highly recommended!

401,"The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!
",others
402,"La Prima is an excellent, no nonsense coffee shop.  It gets very crowded on Saturdays, but I always try to stop in for a double espresso.  You're not going to want to bring your computer.
",others
403,"Cute little shop and delicious coffee!! They have all the regular stuff with a few specialty drinks. The menu is mixed in with some fancy italian terms.. :) I decided to go with moka which was a really good choice. And without knowing what egg cream (chocolate) is, my friend ordered it out of curiosity. We were told that it was made out of sparkling water (they use san pellegrino I believe as they also sell that as bottled drinks), chocolate syrup and foamed milk. It was served on ice. I have never had the combination of milk and sparkling water and it is surprisingly good! Good option for non-coffee drinkers.The best part It is 2 doors down from a popcorn store(which is also a local favorite too, expect lines out the door). We ended up sitting outside enjoying coffee and popcorn for the rest of the afternoon.

406,"Elizabeth from The Botanical Emporium did my wedding flowers and they were absolutely beautiful! They were so easy to work with and made me feel completely at ease. My flowers were everything I ever wanted and more. When I saw my bouquet it actually brought tears to my eyes! The greenhouse is amazing!  I very highly recomend the Botanical Emporium for all of your floral needs.

407,"What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. The place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). I had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. They also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.

408,"Lovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  Her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  You cannot beat the service here.  When students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  Blooming Dahlia is the best example of hometown service I could imagine.
",others
409,"Don't buy those old pre-made arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places.  Come here- the service is great and the price is very reasonable.  Without realizing it, we walked in 5 minutes before closing time.  Regardless, the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us.  I told her I didn't know anything about flowers, so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet.  Even though it was the end of the day, the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular.  Couldn't have been happier and will recommend it to everyone I know.
",others
410,"The best bouquet of flowers I have purchased in years. The store was closed but the door was unlocked and the owner gave me a warm getting and created a great arrangement. I love that they do not sell pre arrangements, all are made as you wait. The so smells amazing. Well be my new go to for flowers.
",others
411,"To say that these guys go above and beyond is an understatement.  My daughter was recently hospitalized and her boyfriend sent flowers.  Unfortunately they were delivered to the hospital the day my daughter was discharged (a good thing that she go out early!!).  Jim from Blumengarten called me from the hospital - which was a good 25 minutes away and offered to meet me halfway to ensure the flowers were delivered.  He told me he would meet me in about 30 minutes.  We both pulled into the parking lot at the exact same time and my daughter received her flowers.  I know who I am ordering flowers from next time I need them!!  Thanks again!!
",others
412,"I chose them because they answered the phone after 5. I was originally going to use a nearer florist. The worker I dealt with was incredibly helpful. As I did not have an exact address to give him, only the name of my girlfriends employer. He said he would look up the address and number, then call them for exact directions. The flowers were delivered within 24 hours and were the best I have ever purchased! I wish I could give them more than five stars!
",others
413,"We live in Virginia and my wife's 72 year old mother lives in Pittsburgh. We typically send her flowers for her birthday, but we've had some issues with the well-known national flower delivery businesses, so I thought I'd see how things went if I cut out the middleman and dealt directly with a local florist. It was a good move. The flowers arrived on time and according to my mother-in-law the arrangement was spectacular and the flowers were so fresh that she was sure they'd keep for a good while. I also was happy that Ludwig's didn't gouge me on all of those extra fees that usually get tacked on at check-out by the big companies. My advice from now on is to go local whenever you can. With the internet that's no longer a problem.

414,"I live in Boston, Ma,but my boyfriend lives in Pittsburgh and I was in need of flowers for a funeral service.  Considering I know nothing about what is top rated in Pitt, I looked to the web to try and find a good florist.  I saw Blumengarten and glad I decided to use their services!  The gentleman on the phone was so wonderful.  I explained that I needed flowers delivered to the funeral home in a few days.. I told him the two flowers that were her favorite and said that they needed to be used, but to do what ever else he thought would make the flowers beautiful.  I gave him the amount I wanted to spend and left it all up to him.  Absolutely wonderful customer service!   The day of the service I got a text from my boyfriend saying my flowers were stunning and and the most beautiful ones there!  Was so happy I chose Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten Florist and will continue to use them!!!  On a separate occasion, I also ordered some flowers online and had them sent to my boyfriends work as a surprise.  Again, absolutely beautiful, cheery flowers!!!!  I got a picture of them sent to me and couldn't have been more happy with what was delivered.
",others
415,"I can't say enough good things about Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten.  We hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in April, 2012 and the flowers were gorgeous!  My bridal bouquet was so beautiful and fragrant that it made me cry!  What I especially loved was that Jim and Linda Ludwig personally delivered the flowers to the venue.  Jim pinned the boutonniere on my husband and personally handed me my bouquet.  Such excellent customer service is rare these days and I highly recommend this business.
",others
416,"I'm a foreigner and wanted to send flowers to my girlfriend living in a suburb of Pittsburgh. I contacted Jim Ludwig's Blumengartens florist after finding them here. Unfortunately they didn't deliver to the city I wanted my flowers to be sent to, but the Ludwigs have been very helpful and transferred my order to another florist that covered that area. The contact has been fast and very friendly. I'll recommend and would consider them again.
",others
417,"Bob Ludwig at Blumengarten is the best! I had a last minute event for which I needed very specific flowers. I called in to make sure they had orchids, which they got just for me in less than a day. I wanted to pick the rest on site, but got there with a few minutes left until closing time and in a rush to deliver them myself. Bob made me a beautiful arrangement at a reasonable price very quickly. I am going to go here for all my future flower needs!
",others
418,"We worked with Sherry at Jim Ludwig's for our wedding flowers in June 2013. They did a truly wonderful job. The flowers were stunning. Sherry was great to work with, and they were very respectful of what our budget was. Many other places I went to advised me they could not remain within our budget, and therefore they lost our business (and our budget was very reasonable) so I appreciated how much they worked with us. Definitely recommend them!

419,"I just utilized this florist today for the first time. My mum's bday is today and I decided last minute that I wanted to send her a bouquet of flowers for a reasonable price and same day delivery. While looking thru some florists in the Pittsburgh area, I saw a yelp review that this florist delivers on same day service. I visited the website and saw so many bouquets of beautiful flowers at reasonable prices. I contacted them via phone- placed a same day delivery, and overall was very pleased w the customer service. My final review of Blumengarten's comes down to the approvement & excitement of my mum- who was very pleased w the flowers.Kudos to Blumengarten, you've gained a new a customer.

420,"Have ordered from Jim about 5 or 6 times and each order was flawless. They do everything right - efficient in taking an order, putting together a beautiful arrangement, and getting it delivered when it is needed. Our most recent order was a few days ago for a funeral viewing and it was very nice as always.  Great people, quality work, and you don't need to wonder if they are going to get it right. They are our go-to florist.

421,"Walk through the door and immediately the sweet, spicy scents of flowers and greens envelops your senses. Fresh green earthy ferns, spiky AND soft cacti, terrariums filled with tiny worlds you'd love to explore in Tiny Alice form all crowd antique tables, shelves and hutches - a bounty of natural wonders there for sweet discovery. The walls teem with both strikingly colorful and softly demure wreaths and wall accents. One glass topped and fronted case has huge jars of the most wonderful potpourri that you can scoop to your heart's content....just imagining your bedroom, living room, your entire home smelling like a little piece of heaven. Then, just as you pass that glass case an open door and a secret garden beckons with wonders of green outside. Melodious chimes, gurgling water, wondrous plants that you are certain deserve special places under no less than the glass roofs of Phipps Conservatory. What a wonderful respite from the rush and noise of the Strip....a quiet oasis. Thanks, Roxanne. Well done.

422,"I adore Roxanne's! There are so many beautiful arrangements and terrariums, and a great variety of live plants inside and out. You can also find lovely home decor in the form of side tables and such. On that note, I have even purchased an ethically made dress here! The employees are always a pleasure to chat with, and prices are reasonable for the quality you get. Even if you're not in the market for any of the aforementioned, stop in here and fulfill your senses.

You really need to step in here to get the full picture of everything they have to offer....because, it's basically everything!

But that's the fun of shopping here!

I loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more. 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve. Ha!!All I got was a postcard, this was the only place I found in the Strip District that sold them. Will definitely be back, and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time!

",others
431,"I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this place... I didn't get a chance to look around the store - I went for a meal in Maria's kitchen upstairs.  It really is HER KITCHEN, not a restaurant... There is only one table that seats 8-10 people.  But her cooking is amazing.  Lots of home-style italian favorites come out in a fabulous 6 course meal.  I could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere, herbs and croutons... delicious.  For dinner, we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans, homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce, veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else.  Tiramisu for desert.  Everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus Maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general.  Wine was BYOB, and I think we went through ~10 bottles.  No corkage fees...This is an amazing dinner for those who have patience.  Maria is booked around 7 months in advance for those looking for a weekend date.  Do like I did - make your reservation, put it on the calendar and be patient... it's worth the wait.
",others
432,"I can't say enough about Merante's and Maria. The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods. Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! The menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. The next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months! My only complaint, Maria is in serious need of a clone.

I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches. You'll be hard pressed to NOT buy anything before you leave.

437,"Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed.

It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles.

There are toys for both kids and adults, gag gifts like beer goggles, books, bath and body products, ornaments and what is my favorite to look at, funky jewelry.  If you're shopping for a literary friend, a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (Why, yes, I would like one!).  Even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd, the jewelry is beautiful.The aisles can get cramped with people browsing, but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see.

Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she ""kinda likes it"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door. Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile...

446,"Named for Pittsburgh greats, Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  Originally the Regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.  As a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch.

PICT, as the name implies performs pieces of Irish and classical theatre seasonally at the theaters of the University of Pittsburgh in the Stephen Foster Memorial (attached to the Cathedral of Learning).

449,"I hate to sound like a broken record but I have to agree with my fellow reviewers: PICT is a wonderful theater and production group! It makes me so proud to see the talent in this city whenever I attend one of their shows. I guarantee you that if you check back each season you'll find at least one show to enjoy. Every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows. I've seen a classics such as ""Antony and Cleopatra"" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) ""In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)."" My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named ""Our Class,"" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about, sadly, real events: a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland. No one wanted to speak during or after that show, and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well. Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important project.I have plans to see at least one more if not two more PICT performances this year; not once have they disappointed me, and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding. Thank you, PICT!

450,"I have been a subscriber to the Pittsburgh Opera for 5 years.  I have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably New York City and Sidney, and I feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in Pittsburgh.  The season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  The Benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  I also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the Pittsburgh Opera.

It's one of my favorite venue's to see a show because it's a whole experience.  There's not a bad seat in the house because it only holds about 200 tables.  Plus they have VIP seating in the front, which provides you with some comfy sofa's to sit on.I'm very excited to see a new caterer come in since the companion restaurant closed next door.  I wasn't too thrilled with the food selections...I really don't know how you make Pizza bad...but they somehow did.  I loved The Big Bang and I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.  They honestly do a fantastic job casting the shows.  I have my own personal favorites, it's my own personal fan club of one!Keep in mind there's discounts if you work for certain corporations, you're a student or you come a in group.  Everyone loves a discount!  Go see something so you can stop singing the same Cabaret lyrics over and over again every time you think of the place!

This was really nice as we have  a 7 month old at home (amazing how fast they can burn through clothes).However, I have to focus on the actual venue and production. I can honestly say that my wife and I had a blast. We thoroughly enjoyed the topic, the performer, the view from our seats, and the food was very simple and tasty. We encouraged many family and friends to go (some did and were equally impressed) which speaks to the impact the evening made on us.

455,"I have been to the CLO Cabaret for several shows and for salsa dancing and have had a great experience every single time.  I love live theater and the CLO offers a fun and unique alternative way to enjoy that experience.  The seating is set up in such a way that there is not a bad seat in the house.  Along the sides you are seated in high bar tables, the middle section is typical table seating and the back of the house is raised on a platform to allow for easier viewing.Most of the shows at CLO are small ensemble casts or only one or two actors.  The way the room is set up, you feel like you know them by the end of the show.  The quality of the productions is fantastic.  I've seen both plays and musicals and the acting, staging and sets have been great for both.  It is amazing what can be done through simple stage sets and props to bring the show to life.  The only down side is that drinks are on the pricey side ($8-9 for a class of wine, $10+ for a mixed drink).  However, you are paying for the convenience of drinking while enjoying a show and the drink prices are pretty comparable to some of the other bars in the cultural district.  I look forward to my next visit to CLO.

You sit at tables rather than the usual side-by-side audience seating and can order drinks and food beforeduring the show.They have a small bar which seemed to get quite overwhelmed during intermission. We had to wait a while to get a drink, but there were a lot of people there all at once, so that is bound to happen.The ushers and other staff were all very polite. I was also impressed by some of their past shows they had displayed on the wall and would definitely go back for another show!

They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! I absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stageset, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! They also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! Again, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!

459,"Very cool theater.  Different in that it is modern but still located in the Theater District.  It's easily accessible and in a great location.  Probably the best aspect is the intimacy of the theater.  Only drawback is that any noise made can be heard a long ways...  (i.e. be careful with children)I went to see Electra thanks to Yelp's Culture Month.  The tickets were half price!  Can't be that!  We were 6 minutes late, oops, but the box office was still able to give us our will call tickets and we were lead to watch the performance on a monitor until we could be taken inside.  We were lead inside with 3 other couples while the show was going on.  The only drawback was that we kind of had to just sit wherever (instead of our assigned seats) so as to not make much ruckus.All in all, FANTASTIC performance, and lovely theater.

460,"We just saw ""As You Like It"" here and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The cast did a great job engaging the audience. It was a long show (two and a half hours) but I was surprised afterwards that it didn't feel nearly that long and kept my attention throughout. My only issue was the difficulty in understanding all of the Shakespearean English, but it was easy to follow the storyline.I think our usher may have been having an off-night. We were led to two wrong sections before we found our seats ourselves. We have been here a few times and have will definitely be back for more!

463,"This is by far and away my favorite theater in Pittsburgh! If you've ever been here you KNOW how beautiful it is! It's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state. It holds around 2,200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country. As you can see, I'm a total nerd about this theater.So let me give you some BIG insider tips about seating! Avoid at all costs the outer sides of the Left and Right Orchestra (the floor) in the front. You can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the Left and Right sides but only sit on the aisle. IF an aisle seat isn't available, go for First or Second Tier. I would rather see the show from far away than half see the show! The touring Broadway, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform here. So go support our local theater! Just remember it's right here in the burgh, it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to NYC!

464,"Perfect Valentine's day date experience. I decided to book tickets for the Dracula Saturday Matinee so that we could have a night out on the town after the show. This theater is really exquisite! Prepare to go back in time to the decadence of the 1920's.Marble, sconces, crystal chandeliers, staircases, and brass railings adorn the beautiful space. Take some time after the performance to tour the interior rooms!The ballet was immensely enjoyable in it's own right. The back drops dark, sinister, and ethereal all at the same time. The dancers floating gracefully around the stage as if their feet fluttered just above the ground. Classical music flowed into the hall and moved with the performers during the most intense scenes. It was so romantic. I can't wait to go again!Pricing is quite reasonable too. You can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center. $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house. I love that on the website you can choose your own seats. Parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage. Take some time out to visit this theater!

465,"The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as ""Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement."" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a ""photoplay"", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD ""The King Is Dead"" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called ""progressive rock"" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single ""Down by the Water"" reminds me of Firetown's ""The Good Life"" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). So it was no surprise that after doing ""The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3"", Colin Meloy told the audience ""I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band."" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song ""Rox in the Box"". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song ""Rise to Me"". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.

466,"I always love coming to the Benedum.  We attended Wicked on a recent Sunday night.  I am always astounded by the beauty of this theater.  Here are a couple interesting facts:  The mirrors, marble and woodwork in the Grand Lobby are all original.  There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  We had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.  And while the seats are showing some signs of wear, the good news is the 2,881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450,000.You know, it always feels really special here.  No matter what event we attend.  Looking forward to coming back during the holiday season.

468,"I love it here! It is like walking into a little piece of history, I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day. Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay. Cue in Detroit, sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,

469,"I was lucky to get a tour of the Benedum last month, and I was completely impressed.  This is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details.  It is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical, the opera, ballet, or a concert.  The staff is amazing and extremely professional, they run this place like clockwork.  I love the natural acoustics of the building, although I don't recommend that you sit under the balcony, that's the worst place to hear a good sound.  Don't worry about getting over-dressed for an event at the Benedum, this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes elegance.

472,"I've seen several shows and have always enjoyed this venue. Here is the breakdown of the 5 stars given... 1 star for Location- Smack dab in the middle of uptown- an easy walk from my apt. A lot of restaurants are right there so it makes dinner and a show a convenient thing to do. 1 star for Staff- Super friendly and helpful. Whether It's where is the will call line or where is the ladies room You'll always receive a polite response.1 star for Ladies Rooms- I have waited before- but never long. I also like that they have tv's situated everywhere so you don't miss any part of the show if you cannot wait for intermission.1 star for Seat comfort- Roomy enough for me- miles above Ovens arena in my opinion. 1 star Productions- They have great productions and always have a few each year on the line-up that are must-see's! It does everything I need an arts center to do !

473,"I've loved every venue under their umbrella i.e. Booth Playhouse, Belk Theater, Knight Theater, and Spirit Square. The shows are great and you can find some deals if you visit their website. I've never had a bad time at one of their performances. I did not have a good experience volunteering for them though but this is about Arts & Entertainment.

474,"This is an awesome cozy venue!!  Get on their email list and see everything they offer!  Hilarious plays (just saw Every Christmas Story Ever Told last night....so funny...these people should really pay me to come and see their shows cause I laugh nonstop!)  They also have cult classic movie nights (like Gremlins!  hilarious!  and free!!)  Decent wine and beer selections and prices.  Go to the website and hunt down the PWYC (Pay What You Can Night) and you can have the chance to see the show for a discount.  If you do this though remember it is first some first serve.  So get there early around 6:30pm and grab a number, when they call your number go and pay what you can (suggested contribution can be around ten bucks).  Awesome spot!

Check them out for sure!

476,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I personally love musicals, enjoy plays... so my 1st encounter with ATC was when they're showing The Great American Trailer Park Musical in August 2010.  Cmon people, how can anyone pass that up!!  The performance was GREAT.  The stage is small, which turns out to be one of the reason I like this place.  There is NOT a bad seat.  You can see everything.  By the way, seating is not assigned and 1st come 1st serve.  On a hit show, that can be a problem if you want to sit with your honey (or whoever).  Get there early enough to get your choice seating.  Then I found out about the Pay What You Can Night, which is normally a Wednesday.  That night you will get to enjoy the same show for whatever you can scrap up from your couch (or $10 is suggested).  For people who are on tight budget (hmm... me & lots of my friends), it's a great opportunity and I am very very appreciative of it.  (Check their website for PWYC date for each show)  Drinks & snacks (aka chips & cookies) priced reasonably, $3-5 for beerwine, $1 for a snack pack.  Parking is free and plentiful in the lot next to the building.  Since then I've seen 39 Steps (hilarious... though I don't think that's the original intention) and Every Christmas Story Ever Told (not growing up in the US, I totally missed all the references... so not as funny for me).  I am looking forward to Pageant the Musical.

477,"Support local! I love this place and they have a special showing of all their shows I think at least once a month called 'Pay What You Can Night'.  That's just icing on the cake.  I went here last night with my girlfriend and our friends and I wasn't really looking for anything fantastic in terms of talent or venue.  Boy was I surprised.  Maybe not so much in terms of the venue but the talent was superb.  The staff and opening host of the show were super friendly.  The place really has a grass roots feel to it and I love it.I would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theater.

There really isn't a bad seat in the house (unless you have visionhearing problems).  The beer and wine selection at their concession has much more variety than I expected and their box office is a breeze to deal with.  Seriously, how many times can you go see Phantom  Avoid the tired mainstream stuff and check out the edgy shows that ATC is putting together.  You won't be disappointed and you might even expand your horizons.

A Jingle Jangle Christmas, to name a few.) I always love their performances, and their selections keep me coming back over and over.I have also been lucky enough to meet some of the staff through a mutual friend, and can say that they have the nicest staff imaginable. The theater's success is no doubt due to Dan, Chip, Robert, Mike, Carrie, and Maile.The tickets and concession prices are more than reasonable, but if you're on a budget, check the website for their Pay What You Can nights for each production. Another favorite of mine is Cult Movie Mondays, the last Monday of the month, which is free with free popcorn. Next time you're looking for something to do with your evening, check out what's playing. It will definitely be worth your while.

A big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking.  It offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre.  Sometimes, they offer beer and wine whose names compliment the theme of that evening's production.  ATC also features Cult Movie Mondays in addition to plays and musicals.  This evening's performance of ""The Divine Sister"" delivered the bawdy, irreverent humor that is characteristic of this theatre.  Another success in a long line of accomplishments.

484,"Most Charlotteans don't realize that we have such a fabulous ballet company in residence here in our fair city. It is led by Artistic director Jean Pierre Bonnefoux and his wife Patricia McBride who are world renowned for dancing in the New York City Ballet under George Balanchine. What does that mean for non dance connoisseurs It means young dancers want to come to NCDT from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patrons.NCDT has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets, but they also excel at classic, storybook ballets like Romeo & Juliet, and funny children's ballets like Cinderella. But their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer Dwight Rhoden who you may have seen on So You Think You Can Dance) is the innovative contemporary works. In fact their annual Innovative Works in late fall often sells out. It features several short pieces that often have a theme or message.  My favorite piece, Satto, was featured again recently in Director's Choice was originally an Innovative Work. Another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with Anna Gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time. The artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles. You may not like every single piece, but at least they're conversation pieces. Similarly, you're not going to love every painting in the Mint. It's worth seeing something other than Nutcracker, so dive in, the water's fine.If I have any complaint, it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and Jean Pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts. Kind of like John Fox.I grew up watching such dance companies as the SF ballet, Bolshoi, Joffrey Ballet, ODC, Alvin Ailey and the CincinnatiSan Jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeo.Ladies, one more selling point in two words: eye candy. Glistening, muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me.

Some bands I've seen here include Stars, Bright Eyes, She & Him, Jonny Lang, The Mars Volta, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - one of the most memorable shows ever because Karen O. was swilling from a bottle of champagne, fell off the stage, and managed to keep singing the entire time without missing a note or spilling a drop.

510,"I just visited this super fun frozen yogurt shop today and I am totally in LOVE!  It is self-serve frozen yogurt that you add your own toppings to.  They have a bunch of flavors to pick from, so you can mix and match.  They also have loads of fresh fruit, chocolate, sprinkles and even mochi & red bean paste to put on your delish frozen yogurt.  After you pick out everything you want, they weigh it and charge you per ounce.  It is a really fun place to go, and it tasted great!I had pineapple, mango and strawberry fro-yo topped with fresh pineapple, mango, coconut, mochi and kiwi.  A word to describe  Scrumdiddlyumptious!
",others
511,"I am far too obsessed with this place. It has cute seating and the yogurt is delicious. I mostly veer towards the originalCalifornia tart and green tea. I top with blueberries (antioxidants!), mango, kiwi, mochi, andor shredded coconut. Beware of the large cups and the desire to fill the entire thing!! After the first time, I learned my lesson and now I usually leave with a $2-$3 cup of yogurt that satisfies completely!
",others
512,"Great flavors, great toppings. I always stick to the ""tart"" flavors, plain, California, mango, etc., and usually get mine topped with fruit. The only thing I don't like is that it's ""self-serve"".... So many people not washing their hands, touching the machines, etc. Ahh well.  The tart frozen yogurt is delicious and a healthy addiction! The prices are high too.... But that's typical of other tart fro-yo places; apparently the mix is pretty expensive compared to the 80's style fro-yo.
",others
513,"Excellent frozen yogurt, huge selection of flavors and toppings.  The best part is that it is self-serve; so you can have as little or as much as you like, as few or as many toppings, etc.Everything is sold by weight ($0.47oz).  A very reasonably sized bowl ended up being about $5.I wish they had one of these in Ames IA!

",others
515,"Ok I have been to a lot of froyo places in Chicago, the suburbs and even out of the states.  Let me tell you nothing beats Cocomero!  The best part about this place is that it's self-serve with fresh variety of toppings.  The design of this place is pretty nice, it seemed like a picture out of an ikea catalog.  I wish my University had this, lucky for UofI students they can get it anytime.
",others
516,"I've been to a similar concept store in Wheaton. This place seems pricey (some $0.47 per ounce), like that one, but the sheer amount of flavors and toppings is overwhelming compared to other stores like it.I had a lactose-free mango frozen yogurt, and some pomegranate-based yogurt. Both were very good, and I had no complaints about them. There were many other flavors available, including the oddly-named ""European tang"".The toppings included yogurt chips, mochi (!!!), a brownie, very fresh fruit (yes, the mango was ripe) and more. The store design is very bright, very pastel and very smart. I might just be back here tomorrow if I'm craving more frozen yogurt. Hopefully I can try some of the more chocolately or crunchy toppings next time.
",others
517,"On my recent trip to California I made it a point to get to two froyo places - Pinkberry and Yogurtland.  Despite liking the tartness of PB's original flavor, it just couldn't match up to the variety of flavors, toppings, and the cheap pricing of YL.  Unfortunately, from what I had heard, the only other froyo place with the ""by-the-weight"" model in Chicago was pretty bad.I've known about the one in Champaign for a while but I'd never gone...perhaps due to a fierce loyalty to Jarling's Custard Cup and the Moonstruck that Cocomero replaced.  But, as a lover of froyo I had to see what the fuss was about...Fellow Yelpers, Yogurtland has come to the Midwest.  Tons of flavors, tons of toppings, cheap price, and super happy decor.  And most importantly - it's good.  ESPECIALLY the red velvet froyo.  My friends described my reaction as if I had just saw the love of my life.  In-freaking-tense.  I'm happy I have a Custard Cup alternative to go to if I visit UIUC in the colder months.
",others
518,"YES, so good. I go to school about 45-60 minutes away and I drove all the way to Champaign for this. OK well I went shopping too.Cocomero is DIY frozen yogurt and I love that concept. There are a ton of different flavors. Pick one or mix and match. They will also give you taster cups, which are really hard to eat yogurt from. I don't get it. Once you have your yogurt, go to the topping bar and choose what you want. They have all kinds of fruit, nuts and candies. I recommend mochi :) Then, you weigh your creation and pay by the ounce ($.47oz I believe). Sit down or take it to go. YUM.
",others
519,"I've been to about a dozen different froyo places, and I still use Cocomero as my gold standard. Nothing beats this place! The vast variety of flavors, the great taste, the decor, the price -- everything!I'm dying to head back to Chambana just so I can get a mere spoonful of my peach flavored froyo. You would not believe how difficult it is to find that flavor anywhere else, let alone some of their other ones, such as Kahlua and Bailey's Irish Cream. See what I mean by VAST variety of flavors No one else comes close!

However, it is usually a lot sweeter, so if you have a sweet tooth ask for more syrup!

Quite often then tapioca bubbles have just been freshly prepared, and recently I've noticed that they have other options like lychee jelly. For that matter, It seems like every other time I go back there is some kind of new tea flavor or variety on the menu.On top of the tasty drinks the staff is always super friendly and the environment is relaxed and comfortable. Great place to hang out on a lazy Sunday.

The owners are really friendly!
",others
528,"Their milk teas are perfect. Very subtle flavors with just the right amount of sweet and milkiness to tea ratio. I think they blend their teas rather than shake, but it comes out tasting smooth, refreshing, and cool. I also appreciate they keep their indoor temperature at normal levels. Who wants to be ice-blasted by the air-con I can actually wear a t-shirt inside, rather than have to bring a sweater with me on a hot summer day. Or, I can sit outside on their cute furniture with my cool drink. They're a bit of a ways from campus, but whenever I'm in the area I try to stop by and support this unique find in Wisconsin.
",others
529,"I cannot possibly say enough nice things about this place.  Their bubble tea is delicious - real tea, lightly sweetened tapioca pearls; sweet and refreshing and never cloying.  I particularly recommend the red milk bubble tea.  I've tried bubble tea other places since Jade Mountain opened, but nothing else compares.Their chicken and pork pot stickers are perfect snack food, and the pork ramen is excellent - better than Umami's at half the price.  They have a tendency to run out of the various food items on the menu, but there's usually an equally good alternative available.Throw in friendly staff, casual atmosphere, good prices, wifi, and a rewards program, and Jade Mountain is well worth my commute from the west side.
",others
530,"I can't stress enough how great this place is.  I've been coming here regularly since I discovered it last winter and will continue to do so. The first thing I noticed about this place was their great customer service.  The workers are always friendly - especially the owners - and you can tell that they try to get to know a lot of their regular customers.  They're also very helpful in answering any questions about the teas and can give recommendations.  Thumbs up on the milk tea, mountain tea (a really unique and great taste), coffee and the fruit teas.  The little desserts are a nice touch and the one I've tried was good.  Their steamed buns are good as well.The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the pork ramen.  My friend and I both tried it and neither of us liked how fatty the pork was.  The ramen is okay but I probably wouldn't order it again for the price.  But overall I find their prices to be very reasonable.

I first tried bubble tea at Bubble Island in University SquareEast Campus Mall, and since that went south, I've been searching for bubble tea. And then Steepery came, and I found it. Of course, there are other things to love about Steepery too - mainly the multitude of flavors they offer as add-ins. Where else in the central downtown area can you get a lavender chai latte Also, Steepery's refreshingly tech-savvy for a local shop - they've got an iPad cash register, Belly rewards app, WiFi, all that fun stuff.Only thing I don't like (and this may have changed since the last time I was there) No gift cards. Instead, they do it by pots of tea - you can buy 10 pots, 20, etc. I'd prefer a traditional dollar-amount gift card option, if they haven't started doing it already.EDIT: Five stars, five stars - they do sell gift cards!

551,"This is semi new, they've been open for at least the last month or so. But it seems no one has really come out and checked it out. It's located on Ft. Apache and Tropicana to the left of Tropical Smoothie or Mashisoyo. The sign says ""Grand Opening Homemade Ice cream and Boba"", it doesn't have a name on the signs yet so it's hard to see it. All the ice creams are all homemade and made right there in the shop. The prices are not bad at all, for a single scoop it is $2.50, double scoop $3.50, and every extra scoop is another $1. They have many flavors, if you look at my picture you can sort of see the menu (I'll update a little later). The Asian flavors are what stuck out to me the most. They allow free sampling of the flavors, so yes I did try them all and actually liked all of them. One flavor that's not on the menu itself is Durian, but if you ask for it, they'll give it to you. Now this was the first time I ever had Durian, and it was delicious (now I have to try the actual fruit). I've heard it was either a hit or miss with Durian as some people really hate it or really love it. The flavors aren't imitation which you can easily tell after taking a bite into it. I haven't tried the Vegan ice cream yet, but it's non-dairy and it's worth a shot if you're lactose intolerant or vegan. They have waffle cones  bowls which is only an additional 50cents!They have milk tea, slush, and hot tea which all the prices are very fair.They have a stamp card for the boba drinks buy 5 get one 1.I'm not going to take off for service, but I've had some bad run-in's with their service. Owner going on vacation and they close, but when asked for a return date, they either don't know or give me the wrong date. As I love the ice cream I came back several times when they said they were going to be open, to bring my mother who is visiting from out of the country, and they weren't open or were rude. The owner while he was working did not acknowledge me at all while in the store, only acknowledged my friend, which was rather rude. But I'm willing to give him another shot. If I based this review off of service I would only give them 1 star as it was a major disappointment. But alas, the ice cream is well worth it to me.
",others
552,"I love all the Asian Flavors that they have, especially Durian ice cream! Their ice cream is freshly made at the store and the owners are exceptionally friendly. They offer samples and do not get annoyed when you want to try multiple samples. In addition to all their wide variety of flavors, they are also one of the few places that offer vegan ice cream too! Currently they have vegan vanilla, chocolate, and mango. They are open to making more flavors if there is a demand for them. I love supporting our local small businesses! =D
",others
553,"Putting aside the fact that when i first went, they had some bad impressions (owner on vacation, closed shop for over a week, no ingredients to make ice cream to replenish stock, etc). If i based the review on that only, i'd probably give them 1-2 stars. But i gave them many chances to recover.Located on the SW corner of Tropicana and Ft Apache, next door to Tropical Smoothie (take note the address from yelp, on more than one occassion, has led the person to the area down the street). Easy way to get to this place would be turning right at the Hobby Lobby sign on Ft apache, and then taking a left. I had first heard about this place from a friend, saying they had durian ice cream. i was ecstatic to hear this news and been waiting a LONG time to try this place. There are 3 different ""areas"" of ice cream. First is the normal type containing like chocolate, banana chocolate, pistachio, etc. Second is the asian type containing green tea, lychee, taro, black sesame, ginger, mango, durian, and guava. Last but not least, something catered to the lactose intolerant, 100% non-dairy ice cream, with flavors of i believe vanilla, chocolate, and mango All the ice cream is made by the owner himself, Peter Wong. He lets you try as many flavors as you want, and he gives you a decent amount (way more than other places for samples). Something good to note is all the ice creams are not overly sweet. They are sweet but very fragrant. All of the ice cream are soft, and very smooth. I've tried most of the asian flavors, including some of the normal, and one of the non-dairy style. Starting by my favorite type, asian flavors ! My least favorite is probably the ginger. There is a slight spice from the ginger that you can taste. Nothing spicy but its like a subtle but noticeable spice. The taro is one of the lighter ones as well. Fragrant , light, with very small taro bits. No artificial coloring (not deep purple like you see in stores, but like very very light purple).The mango and lychee are nice. Sweeter, but fragrant depending on the fruit. The guava (new) is nice. Really fragrant, not too sweet. Out of the ""ordinary"" asian flavored ice cream. The last two is black sesame and durian (so i just noticed ive never tried green tea... hmm) first the black sesame. Made with actual ground black sesame. VERY fragrant. Slightly sweet. Its like the ice cream version of the hot black sesame soup dessert. i love it ! And last but not least, durian. BE WARNED. this is one of the asian fruits where you either will love it, or hate it. It has a very distinct flavor and smell. This is my favorite, along with the black sesame. the durian has a light yellow color. Gives off the actual durian fragrance that you'd expect from the fruit. Same for the taste as well. Very fragrant, slightly sweet. As for the normal flavors, i havent had the chance to try yet, ive been stuck on the asian flavors, but when i visited today, Peter let me try a new creation of his, which was the banana chocolate chip. He said its made with real bananas ! this flavor was really fragrant in terms of the banana. not too sweet either. Honestly, almost rather prefer it without the chocolate chip. the chocolate chip makes it kind of weird Now last but not least, something a lot of places dont offer. 100% non-dairy ice cream. When i had first visited this place, my uncle was complaining about not being able to try any because of his lactose intolerance. Luckily, Peter just created (that day..) something new. 100% non dairy ice cream. My uncle was super happy. Peter was very careful, made sure to not use a scoop that was prior used in the other ice creams. As i had said earlier, there was 3 flavors he had made. When he was getting a sample for my uncle, he said the ice cream was made earlier, and has not completely set yet, but because its been maybe 1-2 hours since freezing process started, there are some areas he was able to get that was solidified. I forgot which flavor was tasted but the texture and flavor was good. Of course its not as fragrant as if using normal dairy products, but it was still good for what it is. Flavorful, semi sweet, and of course, smooth. Highly recommended place for ice cream. Prices are very good as well.Starting at $2.50 for 1 scoop up to $5.50 for 4 scoops. They aren't small scoops either ! :D
",others
554,"It took two attempts to come out here before I was able to try Perfect Scoop. Give them a call before you head over. Besides the after school crowd, their business is not steady throughout the rest of the day and they tend to close early. The second note; they make all of their ice creams fresh and will run out of the fun ones. I had my heart set on durian or black sesame, but both flavors were out. Instead my sister and I shared the pink guava and lychee. Both these light and sweet fruits complimented each other well. We ended up taking a little of both in each bite. If a bolder flavor was paired with either, their subtle characteristics would have been masked.All of their flavors are made in house with no added colors or preservatives. The scoops are generous. The staff are warm and gracious. All of these components made the disappointment of not getting what I came for bearable. Just call ahead of time to see if they are open and fully stocked.
",others
555,"So I'm going to tell you exactly why I gave this place 5 stars.1star: Customer service. The filipino lady working here is pretty awesome. I came in with 3 other friends and of course we asked for samples. :P She pretty much gave us a scoop of all the flavors that we wanted to try. Honestly, we could've had our fill from just the samples but they were just too freakin good. She was patient and took the time to chat with us which I really appreciated.2star: Flavors. This is no ordinary ice cream shop with your typical vanilla chocolate.. its EXOTIC. By exotic I mean, pink guava, black sesame, durian, taro, lychee, mango, green tea, etc etc. No where else in the Las Vegas valley have I found these flavors at an ice cream shop. ANNNNNDDD all are hand made by the owner. What I liked most about it was that all the flavors weren't overly sweet.. you mainly got the flavor. 3star: Price. Cheap cheap cheap. 1 scoop was about $2.50 and the prices go up from there. They also offer waffle bowls and other toppings and you can also get a pint to take home for less than $5 bucks. Thats freakin awesome.4star: Atmosphere. Though the shop is small, there are table and chairs. The lady honestly didn't mind us sitting for half an hour just chatting. In fact, she even came and chatted with us. I can definitely see this as a hang out spot to meet with friends over some ice cream and boba. Especially during the summer time. 5star: Just because I feel like it. They are great!!!Please don't let this place die!! This ice cream shop needs to stay open forever!!!** My favorite was the black sesame

557,"This place is amazing! One of the best impressions of a place from the beginning.The lady that works there is so nice and even opened the place early (an hour before it was supposed to open) when we were waiting outside to realize that it wasn't opened yet. In addition, she gives samples if you ask to try. And she doesn't gip you off the samples either. She lets you try what you want and is very patient and welcoming. The Asian flavors are so unique! Probably the only place I know that makes such interesting flavors from durian, pink guava, black sesame, green tea, lychee, mango, red bean, ginger to taro. What is even more special is that the lady that works there along with her business partner make the ice cream themselves. You can definitely taste the different of homemade ice cream.The price is really good deal for the portion. One scoop is 2.50, two scoops 3.50, and a pint for 4.50. I generally am against having anything durian due to its smell. However, if you get past the first 'impression' of the durian ice cream, it is really good. It has the durian ice cream with a mix of vanilla ice cream I think. I had tried it during the sample, and decided order it as one of the scoops of two.Black sesame is by far my favorite there. If you have had the Chinese sesame balls in sweet soup, it taste exactly like that except in cold form. It is creamy and not too sweet like other ice creams. And if you are person who likes ginger candy or like the taste of ginger, ginger flavor is definitely a must-try. It does have a strong ginger flavor like durian ice cream, however, if you can get past that first impression, it has a rather soothing aftertaste.Also, if you are a person who doesn't want to try the Asian exotic flavors, they do have many other flavors to try.Furthermore, this place is really cozy and the owner was willing to let us hang out there and catch up with friends. The lady that worked there even came up to us at one point to chat with us. Last but not least, this place is not just for ice cream. They do sell various drinks as well. Definitely will come and try other flavors here again.

558,"Who eats ice cream in the dead of a Vegas winter I do and I'll keep coming back for more, all year round. Props to Mr. Wong for making such delicious ice cream flavors with fresh ingredients, especially the Asian ones! Love that they have the typical green tea, lychee, mango, taro, and red bean, but the ones that stand out is the black sesame, ginger, and the infamous durian. Coming from someone who almost kicked a friend out of the car for drinking a fresh durian smoothie, I have to say that their durian flavor is the only exception I'd make for the spiky, smelly fruit.Their prices are so reasonable given the small mountain of ice cream they give you! Dishing out the $3.50 for two huge scoops is a bargain, given how they make the ice cream in house. You could get a pint here for $4.50, and it'd be better than the stuff at the Asian markets.The Filipina lady seriously reminds me of my mom (in a good way, I promise). Friendly, generous, and personable! She served up a sample equivalent to a whole scoop of all the requested flavors for my three friends and I to split. Not only that, but she was genuinely interested in getting to know us too. Almost felt like I was at home there. How often does that happen these daysYou might get brain freeze while enjoying their cheap, chilly treats, but trust me, you won't get the cold shoulder here.
",others
559,"Finally tried their ""non-Asian"" flavors and Perfect Scoop is still pretty solid. Tried Killer Chocolate and Espresso during my second visit and damn, it's freakin' frackin' good! I'm itching to come back and try their ginger flavor. I don't even care if it's 40-30 degrees out, the cold won't stop me from devouring their ice cream. I know they offer other stuff like boba drinks, but for now I plan on trying all of their ice cream flavors. I'm glad a business like this exists here in the valley. I love privately-owned establishments compared to chains. The attention to detail and quality is definitely better. The Filipina lady is charming and very accommodating. Just like Jaimie Y said, she reminds you of that aunt (or in her case, her mother) that is willing to feed you whenever you come to visit or something. NOT TO MENTION THEY HAVE VEGAN ICE CREAM!! I'm not strictly on a vegan diet but this option is quite nice.
",others
560,"I got to try a lot of different flavors as I kept going back, I tried all their Asian flavors, I'm not a fan of the ginger it's a little spicy and not what I expect from ice cream, but they added ginger candy into the ice cream which has a nice flavor. The taro was light, I couldn't really taste much of the taro in it, but it was still good and fragrant. The guava was good too, it was made from pink guava, really light in color, but really good, I loved it enough to take some home. The green tea is good too, tastes a lot better then the ones you find in other stores or prepackaged ones, tastes just like the ones I find in Japan. Black sesame is sweeter then the rest, at least to me it is but it's still really good. The regular flavors I've tried a bunch of them and they're all good, not so sweet as I would find american ice cream to be, but there is still a sweet sense to them all. One that stood out was the banana chocolate chip, but I don't like the added chocolate chip to the banana ice cream, but it's still good. I would actually like to see just banana ice cream by itself.

561,"Omg!!. Where do I start!!. The most moist, fresh and fluffy donuts I've ever had.. At all times of they day, you'll find fresh donuts here. Staff is super friendly.. This shop is the real deal and a must go for Donut enthusiast.

563,"Oh, man... AZ Donut Co is the best worst thing to ever happen to me. These donuts are by far some of the best in the valley (especially when you get them fresh) and they're right down the street from my house, so... well, I'm a regular now and I eat far too many donuts!!
",others
564,"There are several great aspects to this company. First, I'll start with the downfall... because I can only think of one. The wait at the drive-through is extremely long, it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in. I was the only customer in the drive-through, after placing my order I spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected, but tolerable.However, on the plus side there's a DRIVE-THROUGH.  Although it may take less time to just park and walk inside, the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night. The drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a day...how many more ways can I say ""amazing""Next - I love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to Chandler for a decent one from Boba Tea House in Lee Lee's market place complex. Not anymore! This place also sells my favorite taro milk tea. Finally, not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly, but in a positive way), the donuts are delicious and fresh -- I'd recommend this place over the big chains (Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme) any day! Extremely cheap, but be aware: They will not accept credit or debit cards for purchases under $3.  5 stars in my book!

567,"Oh sweet late night heaven.Located where the old KFC used to be on Broadway and Beck across from Palo Verde, this place is a late night dream. Their drive thru is open 24 hours. I rolled thru and was actually taken aback by their extensive menu. After a few minutes of debating w myself, I decided on the vanilla cake and Boston creme. The lady who was working the window was probably the nicest person Ive ever dealt w at a drive thru. She seemed genuinely happy to be there. In minutes I had my donuts and was on my way home.And they were go-od. Cakey and gooey and delicious and *Homer Simpson drool*.Dont be surprised if they dont have the vanilla cake when you go in, I was told they run out of it all the time.
",others
568,"I drive by it all the time on my way to work so last Friday I stopped in. The staff was super friendly which is a stark contrast from the fast food joints I usually get iced coffee from. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant combo, the price with an iced coffee was cheaper than any fast food place and the doughnut holes! Yummy! It has that mom and pop feel and the staff was perky!
",others
569,"I found out about Donut Co. through an admenu and decided to make a midnight run. I noted it was within relatively easy biking distance of the ASU campus, which was exciting since I've been looking for a donut shop that can fit that distinction. I asked my friends to choose which donuts they wanted off of the menu I found and despite the late hour at which I went there was an ample amount of each kind to pick from.The donuts themselves were soft and tasted fresh, particularly the donut holes. I didn't heat them up when I got back since my friends didn't have a microwave in their dorm room, but I'm sure they would have tasted even better warm. And better than their donuts was their boba tea, the special signifier for my 5 star rating.I went for a taro flavored boba smoothie, which I've had before at other boba tea establishments. While I usually enjoy taro smoothies, the way they prepared theirs made it possibly one of the most delicious things I've ever had the pleasure to drink. The taste was akin to the scent of a pumpkin spice candle, but in creamy purple smoothie form. They didn't skimp on the tapioca either. Absolutely perfect drink, even on my chilly bike ride back to my dorm. Cannot recommend this place enough for fans of boba tea.The cashier was friendly and attentive, particularly for a late-night employee. Absolutely wonderful shop.

570,"These very well might be the best donuts in the Phoenix area!  Great price, helpful and happy service.  Great variety (even though I arrived at 4:30 PM) and all items were light, fluffy, delicous, fresh, and not too sweet.  Worth every bite!

572,"We were trying to find somewhere cheap with some decent food in the Madison area. After reading some not so great reviews we decided on this promising joint. It was a short drive from where we wanted to head afterwards and they're cool with you leaving any cars in their parking lot for any amount of time, even overnight.The bar was definitely top notch, especially for a bowling alley. The food was fantastic.  Great sandwiches and burgers, appetizers, and more variety than you'd expect from a venue of this sort. Fast, friendly service topped it all off. Bowling is super SUPER cheap on Mondays and most weekdays. Standard fare as that goes; plenty of lanes and balls to choose from. And to those who make a big deal about them borrowing a shoe, grow up. Highly recommended for some fun with friends or just a few drinks.
",others
573,"I go for the bar, food, and people. Can't say I have bowled there but I do frequently visit. It's a good bar to stop in and just relax for a bit. Patio is nice in the summer time, plenty of room to just relax with friends or family. The staff keeps me coming back. Kitchen can be hit or miss depending on who's cooking. But for the most part your bartenders will work with you. Enjoy some darts, pool, volleyball, or some bar dice. Overall, since I moved here it is like a hidden gem that reminds me of home. Defiantly worth a visit

575,"I had my wedding here. They were great we had correspondence throughout the entire planning phase. However they don't offer many services for weddings. We had to find our own DJ, Photographer, Officiant, ect. However they cater there so we had limited choices on what we can choose from. There is no way to taste test the food prior to your selection either. Same for the Cake they make them there but they only offer whipped cream frosting and fresh flowers to put on top, bring your own topper and ribbon to put around the cake as well. I had my wedding upstairs where the lighting is not to good either. But I have to say my friends and family loved the place, they are still telling me on how that was the best and most fun wedding they have ever been to. So for the price this place is the best! But be prepared to do quite a bit of the work yourself, its not an all inclusive package like you can get at some other places around the valley. But to do it all over again I would still pick this place.

576,"I used to go here up until I was seven years old. Then my family moved to Boston.First, the wave pool is completely amazing to a little kid growing up in Arizona, a kid who may have never seen waves before! And the waterslide was scary as hell, but awesome when I got up the nerve to go down it.And then there are the ducks around the manmade Arizona pond. I loved all those ducks and one time this duck let me put him on his lap and I pet him and he just stayed there! I looked for that awesome duck each time I went back to the park afterwards, but never found him again.

580,"Recommend to family & friendsIf you are in Tempe, you must visit Kiwanis Park. This is such a beautiful park. Not only is it beautiful, family and friends would love it here for the weekend fun or holding an event. My first visit was when the boyfriend and I visited his house, located in Tempe and walking distance to the park. I fell in love with the park. There's a lake and a long sidewalk for runners out there. Best weather to run would be during the fall in the evening. Apparently it's still warm during the fall here, no surprise since we're talking about Arizona, desert state right Haha...What will catch your eyes The lake! Who would imagine desert like Arizona would have water! I didn't... haha. Great place to bring your kids and family here on the weekends of after your meals just to walk around and breathe. What caught my eyes were the sign that says 'crossing ducks' http:www.yelp.combiz_photoscSVmQusncacVHsCHObA1Ggselect=FeK9GKxNBVIGdQlp-FASFwFeK9GKxNBVIGdQlp-FASFw Made me smile :)Take a look at the website : http:www.tempe.govindex.aspxpage=774there's many activities you can do with your family and friends. Oh my, did I mention There's a wave pool inside of the recreation center! You heard me! Wave pool! How cool is that :D There's also a fitness center (might need to be a member), tennis court, volleyball (my favorite!), batting cage, and some rentals (ask them for specific rentals). Seriously can spend a day here. Make sure to watch your children if you are walking near the lake because there is no barrier. Keep your kids by your side just for safely. There are ducks and probably random fishes in the lake. You can fish at the lake, but I wouldn't suggest to take the fishes home to eat. D: So glad this park is just 5 min walk from his place in Arizona. Will come back, maybe next time I'll bring my dog. :)

581,"Who really knew how amazing this park is It is a mecca of fun and good times.They offer so much here, it is hard to cover it all.They have a great little man made water way inside on the Mill Ave side. IT is a giant pond,you can take little water crafts on it.  It has ducks and fish as well. They also have a lot of covered Picnic areas with grills so you can have Birthday Parties and such. All well lit also. Along with clean(as clean as you can get for a park) toliet areas. Lots of rolling hills for exercise or to bring your dog.Our dog loves coming here. It is like disney land for her.On the other side is the grat wave pool, and a great gym. The park offers all sorts of classes and sports leauges for all ages.Lots of places for kids to play.It is just great! The only thing I am not crazy about is on the weekends they sometimes also parties and get togethers here that drive me nuts. Because, the music will start early in the morning and go all night.It can really be loud at times even with your doors and windows closed.Unfortunatly I live close enough to hear it. But, if you have kids or dogs, it is a lot of fun and a great place to explore.

In there you can fish, and boat, or just sit and enjoy the water.Bathrooms are,well park kind. I do not use unless I absolutely have to, but at least they have them.Lots of areas for parties and get togethers. I do not know if you have to get a permit for that, but you can check their website.Lots of places to park and you can ride bikes all around in there as well.

583,"I must start this by saying I am spoiled. Ever since I moved to Tempe in 2008, I lived super close to Tempe Town Lake. I was in love with running at that park, but now I live on the south end of Tempe and TTL is really not convenient in the morning rush hour traffic. Once I discovered that Kiwanis was basically my ""down the road neighbor,"" I have been going regularly. I love to run in the mornings with my dog before the weather gets too hot for him. I think Kiwanis may just be his new favorite place because he loves to chase ducks! This park, while much smaller than TTL, has a ton of ducks, fish, turtles and other types of birds that call the lake their home. You see people with nets and fishing poles out there fishing all times of the day. There is also a huge playground for kids, many pavilions and grills for family get togethers and sometimes they play a movie on a big projection screen in the park. If you're an outdoorsy person, definitely check out Kiwanis Park!
",others
584,"Kiwanis has everything a rec center needs to be considered one of the best. Right to the point, if you ask me. I'll cover it all, but regardless of age, they have all the bases covered. Lets dive into Kiwanis (we can dive into the wave pool later!)~What To Do~What can't you do If you are a child, they offer sports classes up the ying yang like the non-competitive program Sportball all the way to fun swimming classes in the huge pool, no matter the skill level. For adults, the tennis courts are outstanding, as is the fitness room too! Finally, for the older crowd, they have many fun programs available for you to stay active and happy!~The Good~I really feel that to be a true RECREATION center, you have to be able to provide a large variety of programming for the masses. Kiwanis, in my eyes, offers just that and more. They offer the largest variety of programming I have found in the valley. With me personally being a sports coach, I have been to many city rec centers, and no center is the same. This center is at the top of the food chain. They also offer a batting range, A BATTING RANGE. Do this equation: Batting Range + Wave Pool + Gym + Tennis Courts + Awesome Staff = Bonkers Good Facility. Just stop by with your child, sit down to the left and look through their program guide....you will see the breadth of their course offerings..then you will see the huge wave pool behind the desk and be sold!~The Bad~It is an older facility, and being so, there are some visible areas where they could do some minor renovations. However they just re-did the bathrooms and also touched up the walking areas near the softball fields, so you can't say they aren't trying. My biggest complaint is parking, which is situated in bulk on the opposite sides of the center. It makes for a relatively long walk no matter which side you park on. They have a minor row of parking right up front, however if you come anytime really after open on a weekend, don't bother trying to find a spot up front. In the hot summer months, that can be a bit of a nuisance, but really that is worst it gets here....parking... haha :-)~The Down Low~This is my favorite center to teach at. I prefer it over all others. It is the largest, has more options than others, has spacious grass to frolic on (I said 'frolic' in a review, life is complete now), and the staff here are extremely helpful and courteous each time I converse with them. Like I said earlier, just come down and grab a pamphlet with programming info, you will be very happy. Message me if you have questions about programming, I am glad to help!!!

For residents, all of this is free of charge and as the other review stated, for guests, its a nominal $5 fee.

Inside of the recreation center there's a gym, dance room, basketball court, racket ball rooms, game room, kitchen, basically everything. I love the gym the most. There are a variety of machines, weights, and balls to choose from. There is also air conditioning, two tv's, and mirrors. The game hall is also nice. You can play pool and ping pong.

They have lounge chairs and a couple areas of shade to relax. Downside : no booze allowed! The inside has a nice sitting area with a tv and fireplace. They have rooms you can rent for parties and also a bunch of ping pong and pool tables. The rest room has lockers (bring your own lock), a steam room room and showers. There is an area for dance, a huge basketball court, racquet ball courts and a small gym. I have never had a problems getting machines. They only stay open till 9 but it makes me get in there sooner. They have vending machines with cold drinks if you get thirsty after your workout.

I had not really been hitting the gym lately so I had the best time ever grabbing one handed rebounds with my old and new friends, showing them I still have some BASKETBALL game left. My jumpshot was still really nice.  I hit a lot of three pointers and my team won more than 80% of the games we played here.  It was really relaxing, I mean we could have been stuffing our face again in a buffet that day but this really worked.it is the best place to visit, leave the strip next time you are in Vegas and drive over here.

And most of the residents seemed to be in good spirits, which to us says a lot.  The nursing staff was fantastic.  She especially enjoyed her time with Ian, her speech therapist.  Physical therapy team did wonders.  She spent a month in the ICU, sedated for 2 weeks, on a feeding tube, and suffered ICU phycosis before she was brought to freedom plaza care center.  They had her up and walking and taking care of herself in a few short days.THANK YOU Freedom plaza care center staff, for giving us back our mom!

615,"If anyone is looking for a place for their parent or friend, you need go no further.  We were struggling with my father going through the stages of dementia, and general failings of age, medication, etc. and we were referred to this fabulous care home, Sunrise Home Facility, managed and owned by Lida Cubillos.  He is now there and doing so well, we are able to breathe a sigh of relief and all the anxiety about him is now gone for us.  Lida treats everyone like family, but with respect and privacy.  She makes it all clean and comfortable for the 10 residents she and her staff care for.  She was a registered nurse, and is a great patient advocate, she understands meds and the aging process -  coordinating well with doctors, while at the same time  also spending time with the residents herself, making them all feel special.  If you have any questions or want to hear more, please email me at lsscottmac.com, as I know how hard it is when trying to find good care.

The facility is absolutely beautiful and the staff are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. All of the residents I met told me how much they loved living there and everyone seemed so happy! They allow redident to have pets (under 30 lbs) wich I thought was really cool. They even have Happy Hour in the on-site bar!The food was great and the activities they offer residents are amazing. The day I was there they were setting up for Oktoberfest and beer tasting. Nice!If you have a loved one that needs a friendly, safe and fun place to live I would recommend you check this place out!

619,"My husband and I just returned from dinner at McDowell Village with my mother this evening, having had a lovely experience of good food, excellent service, and engaging residents who stopped by our table to say hello.  We've seen McDowell Village up close and personal for the last 8 months, attending special events and dropping in regularly.  My mother has enjoyed concerts, outings to restaurants that we would love to experience, fun card playing, participation in an art show, warm interaction with staff, new friends among residents, and a happy environment that feels like a mini-resort.  The staff has a great esprit de corps with fun, warm and caring attitudes; the residents have universally spoken about how happy they are there.  I would not hesitate to recommend McDowell Village.
",others
620,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about McDowell Village, including Debbie, Kristen, and Jay.  My parents, after searching the area for the right senior residence, decided on McDowell Village and they couldn't be happier.  There are activities all day long and special events for many of the holidays.  The restaurant's ambience is really nice and the food is delicious.  There are summer concerts, happy hour, outings, and shuttles to doctor appointments, local grocery stores, banks, etc. weekly.  The staff is outwardly caring and attentive to the resident's needs.  I live out-of-state and several months ago my mother had a health incident early one morning while I was talking with her on the phone.  I called McDowell Village immediately and they sent an ambulance AND a staff member went up to their apartment and stayed with them until help arrived. The staff's quick response time and ability to handle a potentially life-threatening situation allowed me time to get on a plane and get to my parents without nearly as much stress as I would have felt otherwise.  I could go on and on but suffice to say if you are looking for a senior residence, I highly recommend McDowell Village without hesitation.

I cannot review it much because I do not live here; however, My grandmother is very happy here and well taken care of.They have a daily list of events in which residents can partake in including things that are not on site. Meals each day as well differ and that gives residents chances to change things up. I've ate here several times and the food is very good especially with the plethora of different things cooked up on holidays.Residents are allowed small animals on premises as well which helps with companionship. There is a gym and activity center so that residents may also get exercise. Lastly, my grandmother's favorite----a beauty salon!

629,"I was recently married at a venue that listed them as one of their four caterers to choose from. My partner and I did a tasting of their food, thinking we'd try to meet with at least two to three of the vendors, but after tasting the food (and getting zero response from the other caterer we'd outreached to) we decided to go with All the Best and we were both so glad we did. They were the most reasonably priced of all the listed caterers and I have to say,  going with All the Best, we really felt we got a lot of bang for our buck.The food was delicious and plentiful and the service was truly great - they thought of things my partner and I never would have. All of our guests raved about the food. Even though we got the stereotypical ""wedding food"" it was GOOD wedding food. I highly recommend them for catered events - plus, as a bonus, they own Pittsburgh BBQ company, so we were able to get mini pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, which everyone loved!

631,"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the ""hookup"" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!

632,"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.

633,"My wife booked my son and I for a fatherSon weekend to the GiantsPanthers game. I had no idea a Holiday Inn could be so nice. It offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling. The decor, room, location were all 5 stars! The front desk and valet parking were top notch! I needed to charge my phone and iPad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it. After we were done he parked it again with a smile.We will absolutely be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

Our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years.

If you book through their website, the prices are very reasonable.

Of all of my birthday parties, this one wins hands-down. I know little about their food-but their cakes are pretty amazing!

636,"About me: female, New Yorker, foodie, design-loverLa-Tea-Da's did the reception catering for my wedding. Kelly Matthews was my catering lead and Jessica also helped on the day of the event.My expectations were dramatically exceeded. I would recommend them to anyone for these reasons:1. Flexibility - As an out-of-town bride, Kelly was quick in responses, edits to estimates and suggestions to queries via email since I couldn't attend in-person meetings too often.2. Professionalism - Team worked so I didn't have to think about anything on the day of the wedding. They even prepared plates and drinks for my husband and I so that we didn't wait in the buffet line and had a few minutes at our table to eat before crowds arrived. Jessica helped by directing us during the event as well and giving us heads up on timings. In addition to food, they helped set up decor - even lit lanterns and candles on tables!3. Fair Prices - I wanted interesting food combinations, which doesn't usually go hand-in-hand with reasonable pricing for a big event. However, Kelly was great in offering many choices and speaking to the chef several times to ensure we had great variety.4. Presentation - Food was displayed beautifully. Kelly gave helpful suggestions on how to set up the buffet for good crowd flow throughout the event. My favorite presentation was a small bamboo plate with a BBQ slider and homemade potato chips - delish!5. Quality - I received a lot of questions about who did my catering from friends who are also in the wedding planning mode. Guests loved the food and flavors were appealing to all.Again, can't recommend them enough - definitely add them to your list when interviewing caterers!
",others
637,"La Tea Da's catered both my rehearsal dinner and wedding this past April, and I don't even have words to express how amazing the whole experience was. Being a foodie and someone who works in the industry, I have pretty high standards. I certainly didn't make it easy on them! We brought La-Tea-Da's on as our caterer at the last minute. Seriously last minute - like a week before. Did I mention my wedding was multicultural and I wanted to include a good amount of Venezuelan and Spanish inspired dishes Janet met with me to discuss the menus only days before the wedding, and she put my mind at ease instantly. All of the challenges I thought would be insurmountable, namely my eclectic taste in food, only seemed to excite her more as she threw out creative solutions and suggestions with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store. In the end, I wound up with my dream menu. Incredible passed hors d'oeuvres, Paella, tapas, shrimp & grits, ceviche, gazpacho, tacos, sushi, a Venezuelan parilla station, late night philly cheese steak sliders, and more somehow all came together beautifully to create one of the best food experiences I've ever had. My guests consistently echo my sentiments as well. My only regret was not taking the time to eat even more (though it wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the staff! We arrived to the reception venue to a lovely candlelit sampling for two while the cocktail hour wrapped up and the amazing staff diligently kept our cups and plates full the whole night.) I could go on and on, but let's just say I'm anxiously awaiting a ten year vow renewal of some sort so I can call La-Tea-Da's up and do it all again.

They are always professional and the food is great. in the last week alone, I have eaten their fried chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage, egg and cheese croissant sandwiches, cookies, brownies and a variety of sides.

642,"Wendy C., how can you review a place that you've never been to I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. I gave it a shot and I was impressed! First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. It's worth it though and I'll be back.

They make chicha morada, which is a drink made from purple corn, and is super refreshing.Crandalls is owned by a very sweet family from Peru, and I'm so happy to see that they are now showcasing their roots with their new restaurant!!They do still have their famous fish fry, and it looked like the lunch menu has cheese curds and sandwiches as well as ceviche.

We have had nothing but compliments about our wedding, I would recommend Windsor in a heartbeat!Because we booked our wedding reception on Friday night we were told we would be receiving a ""complimentary"" champagne toast. After the wedding though we received a bill charging us for the service fee and gratuity for pouring the champagne. We paid it without any grievances, but it would have been nice if they would have informed us of this when we were going over the preliminary invoice.

Some of the art they have on display is fantastic. It was interesting the last time I went because local artists were there to sell glass work they made.The Make It Now classes are well worth $25. You get to be somewhat involved in creating the object (You get to pick the color, blow the glass, and do a couple of other things. You never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all. If you want to be more involved, there are other more advanced classes that you can take), plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home!

Here is a list of where it will be http:www.sites.si.eduexhibitionsexhibitshensonmain.htmThe exhibit includes original posters, drawings and notebooks, video clips, as well as Muppets.  Kids will enjoy seeing the Muppets, adults will enjoy the whole exhibit.  At the end was a place for kids to put on a puppet show, make a storyboard and make a face for a Muppet.It was very interesting to get an insight into the genius Henson was, and how if he didn't use an idea in one place, he would try to get it incorporated into something else.Its at this museum until March 9th.

It is a bit young for my kids, but of course they still loved it. The exhibits in the museum were well thought out with opportunities for children to experiment in all different mediums. For example, one of the two exhibits was called Table Manners. We could read books about table manners, experiment with chopsticks and play food, make table scapes and then draw them, and much more. And then of course, there was the art. They had a nice selection, again in different mediums. Museum was clean, staff was friendly and overall, we will visit again if in town.

It costs an admission fee for kids over 1 so it made sense for us to buy a membership if we planned on coming a few more times.  We'll definitely go back!Update 2011:We still have a membership here, it's not too busy on the weekdays, which I have off in the summertime.  On saturdays it can get kinda crazy - go early if you can.  Bring a sweater if you tend to get cold because the AC is CRANKED.  Watch out for the people who don't pay attention and let their kids go bonkers in Artville.  That area is meant for ages 0-4 and occasionally you'll get some bigger kids in there andor one of those jerkface kids that is a little brat while their parent is in a corner, texting obliviously.  you know what i'm talkin' about.

A lot of hands on activities for the children, and the adults can participate too. Definitely a nice place to let your children explore their creative side in the East Valley.

665,"I came here for a birthday party.  It was so much fun.  We were greeted by the front desk.  They informed us that our host were not there yet, but we were welcome to roam around the place.  They had arts and crafts everywhere.  Interesting facts and information on the walls.  When our host arrived we follow our guide to a back area (filled with trees and tableschairs for outdoor activities) and then to a building in the back for our party.  We had the whole back building to ourselves.  It was nice!  Tables, chairs, and art canvasesart supplies all set up.  Signs wishing our birthday girl (with her name on it).  The room has it's own bathrooms so you do not need to run back to the main building.  We had 1-12 hours in the back room.  Then we were free to enjoy the museum.  There are two separate areas artscraft & playlearn room.  I had fun along with the kids.

667,"This quaint little music shop is a secret find of mine.  Great prices, fantastic staff, and knowledgeable staff (important in this business).  I love coming to this music store because they always seem to have what is needed, and having three musicians in our house, that is important.  We recently took an instrument to be looked at for repair and the guy fixed it on the spot, no charge. Of course, we ended up spending money in the store anyways, so it was a win-win for Buchanan Music and myself.  I've me the owner a few times and he's always willing to work with me on prices and helped order me a personalized product once. Highly recommended.

668,"Buchanan Music is an authorized Takamine dealer and Russ is the guy that we've dealt with in the past year.  He is completely awesome.Sometimes calling, whomever picks up the phone, if it's a woman, it's a bit hard to understand her, but as long as we get Russ there's no issues.  He was our go to when we needed to get our Takamine replaced, Russ helped us so much in sending our guitar to KMC Music, but also receiving it, which is another story in itself.  He made sure we got a good guitar this time.  And about 6 months later, the guitar needed some adjustments and Russ did it.  The guitar plays beautifully and we appreciate Russ' talent in working on guitars.  You can tell he loves the instrument and is a master craftsman.We appreciate your work, Russ.  Thank you for helping my husband develop his passion and love for the guitar.

670,"Scottsdale Artist's School is a great place for a workshop. It was an elementary school at one time and still has an interesting traditional quality with beautiful tile floors, generously sized classrooms, a lovely patio, and a professional staff.The school brings notable artists from all over and students also come from everywhere.The Friends of the School organization gave a reception on Thursday with bountiful food & wine. That night there was a gallery walk in Old Town.I enjoyed my week there. Scottsdale itself doesn't have great appeal though there wasn't time to explore much and that is just as well.

671,"Love this internationally known art school.  Whether you are a art workshop junkie or enjoy the open studios, this is an amazing place to learn or improve your skill.  The staff is super helpful.  Due to my work schedule, I have only taken one workshop from one of the famous instructors (although I regularly droll through the online offerings) but drive down to Scottsdale for the evening or Saturday open studios.  Pay $10 for hours of a variety of models in short & long poses.  The school has decades of great reputation for a reason.

Kudos to the entire cast! Folks, this place is really a treasure. I know you've heard people say that nonchalantly about stupid stuff but this is for real!Like all of our other theatres in town, this place deserves our patronage and support. If you don't have kids, go alone or take your niece or nephew! You won't be disappointed.

673,"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.    My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)    I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.     Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for     The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circusrodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show"".

674,"I went to see a show at The Tempe Center for the Arts with my son few weeks ago. Rock the Presidents was showing and it was highly entertaining! The venue was incredibly beautiful. The music was fantastic, the cast was incredible, and the presentation was just phenomenal. We loved it! My son learned so much about the leaders of our country in a 70 minute show. There were students screaming and dancing, fist-pumping, having a blast rocking with the presidents. Thank you for providing such great entertainment! Deserves 5 stars!!
",others
675,"I have never been to a show I didn't like!  Childsplay is the creme de la creme of children's theatre.  The actors are phenomenal and the bees knees at their craft.  Their costumes and sets hypnotize me and reel me in from the get go.  I love their Q&A sessions at the end of each play and the fact that they have a set of questions you can take home with you for the car ride back.  They use literature for the majority of their plays and have new shows every single year.  But what is even better is their traveling shows they send to schools around the valley and country.  If you are lucky enough to get a grant for them to come, you get shows that are just as good as those in the Tempe Performing Arts Center.  Their sets are smaller, but they have their amazing costumes, props, and music along with them.  They still do Q&A sessions after these traveling shows and give us teachers those same questions that they do at the TPAC shows.  It doesn't matter if you are an adult without kids...everyone should attend at least one Childsplay show in their lifetime.  You are missing out if you don't!

The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.

You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home.

689,"GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  A FAMILY GATHERING!  A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!
",others
690,"Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.

691,"I love it!  Love it!
",others
692,"Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. Note the ""drinks are weak"" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. Also note the ""prize center games suck"" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40person.I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.

694,"After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 247 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.

695,"First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!

Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people!

When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!

I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations.

They take the time to work with you, to educate you, and to make you feel special. I can make up classes whenever needed, and  in the three months I've been going there, I haven't yet found them to be closed due to some family emergency or out of school function. Both Ms. Pam and Ms. Angelica are dedicated to ensure that you get the most benefit in your class. They work with you, one on one, and make sure you are comfortable during class. They genuinely care about you! I've also seen what they do with children of all ages, and I am very impressed. The school also has great specials (a ""try before  you buy""), and participate in most local community activities (and NEVER need to close the school to do so!). I'm impressed and proud to be a member of this ""family"", and feel that I have made good friends with both the instructors and fellow students!

720,"I'm writing this review as a alternate perspective of MMAC, because one star, in my opinion, is grossly underrating the value of the dojo. Sensei Rick is dedicated to the art of martial arts, as well as the sport. He focuses on the basics, knowing that a strong foundation in karate is what leads to strong fighting. In this dojo, there are many philosophies, but the essential one is to always ""Kick. Punch. Sweat."" The dojo is made up of hardworking individuals, and the path to a blackbelt is not for everyone.If you were to talk to Sensei, you would see he is dedicated to the community; each year the dojo participates in toy drives and hosts a Karate Kamp; which is an opportunity for kids to participate in karate during the summer.I believe the best way to get a sense of the dojo is to visit it yourself; it is kept neat and clean, and even features a study center so that students can also focus on their academics between training. I highly recommend Mountainside Martial Arts
",others
721,"My son has been in attendance at MMAC for more than 5 years now, and changes have certainly taken place within the organization.  This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata, kumite (sparring), and basics.  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate.  This is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo, like the Cobra Kai in ""Karate Kid"", that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation.  If you are looking for a fight club, look elsewhere.That being said, my son specializes in fighting here and does very well.  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ, CA, UT, CO, and NV.  He has won several of these, and usually medals at every event. He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing.  I am confident in his abilities.The dojo is restructuring, and growing, and all for the better.  It has the best workshops, training clinics, guest speakers, and REAL tournament training by far.  I couldn't be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional, traditional Japanese technique and practical self-defense instruction.

722,"MMAC is an asset to the Ahwatukee community, providing traditional martial arts training where discipline is learned and advancement is earned. This is a traditional Japanese dojo, where everyone doesn't get a medal and you don't buy your child's blackbelt in 2 years; enablement, entitlement, and excuses are not tolerated. My son has been training with the Sensei's of MMAC since 2006, starting in their program held at the Ahwatukee YMCA at the age of 7. Anyone who has met my son will attest to his maturity, balance, and discipline, and I attribute much of that learned behavior to his dedicated training at MMAC.

725,"I used to train in this dojo as a teenager a couple of years ago. Ray Hughes Sensei has got to be one of the best role models in the Martial Arts community. Both Hughes Sensei and Tyler Sensei are incredible with kids, they keep their attention, make the classes fun, but most importantly they properly teach their students how and when to defend themselves. The programs are not only for children, but for all ages, including adults. In fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training, focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself. Basic class setup: Starts of with stretching, cardio, basically a quick warmup. Next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment, meditation is to help calm your mind). Then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing, hand placement, and momentum). Towards the end, there might be sparing drills (safety first, all students are required to wear padding for arms, legs, and a mouth guard). Class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body. The main focus of the dojo is teaching Wado, but there are other floors dedicated for Jujitsu and other Martial Arts Programs. Great, clean facility. Near the Ice Den, so plenty of parking. Located in a safe area. Quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms, and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety. Clean, cold water fountain. Air conditioned, fans to circulate air. Well lit. Spacious locker rooms, clean bathrooms. Well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes. No contracts, just a monthly payment, if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn, then it is well worth the money!

726,"SMAC was a wonderful dojo for our family. My son was there through his purple belt, my daughter through blue. We spent many, many hours there and I cannot sing their praises enough. I appreciate all of the teachers especially Sensei Tyler and Sensei Ray. They are patient yet firm. Their traditional dojo is the real deal.After years of practicing there, when my son decided to leave the dojo to try something else he went to Sensei Ray to talk to him about it, Ray was gracious and encouraging to my 10 year old son. It made all the difference in the world. That is the type of outstanding character Sensei Ray has. My son still remembers what they talked about and knows the door is open for him to come back anytime.

727,"I love love love this place and I'm grateful to Yelp reviews for sending me in their direction. It's only fitting that I add to the reviews. My 4 year old daughter attends the Pee Wee Karate two days a week and she loves it. The two teachers, Ray and Tyler are incredibly funny, entertaining, and know how to relate to kids phenomenally. Truly, I enjoy watching the entire class just to see the teachings and interactions between the sensei and students. The price is reasonable for classes, especially if you partake in the twice weekly option. They're flexible about makeups, too.My daughter is learning karate but also gaining confidence in a beautiful way. It's hard to describe but her experience is so much more than just karate. She's learning to speak in front of a group, getting exercise, having manners instilled more, and having fun at the same time. From what I gather talking with other parents, there are a lot of satisfied families who have been customers for many many years. I look forward to doing the same. Oh... and they had a Halloween party (2014) and I was blown away at the event they put on. It just goes to show how much they truly love these kids. It had so much (tons of food, light show, music, contests, awesome prizes, laser tag in the parking lot, and more).

729,"I am a 53 year old woman. I began taking Karate classes at C-D Young's Professional Karate Center in September of 2012. I started as a white belt, as everyone does. In the beginning I resoned that Karate would be a good physical outlet for my well being. Before long I recognized so many more benefits. I began to notice a growth in my self confidence, along with a sense of accomplishment which sparked a feeling of pride in my acheivements. I began to have higher expectations for myself. I started to push myself towards goals and on Feb. 2, 2013 I earned my yellow belt. That is when I realized that Karate is much more than a physical work out. It is a joy to witness the level of respect between the instructors and the students. At any age, young or old, I am a firm believer that Karate teaches focus. It helps with self confidence and self-esteem and it pushes you to set and reach your goals through perserverance, and it all happens in a fun atmosphere with instructors that are dedicated to show you how to achieve such self growth.

736,"We started at Go For It USA because of Coach Ed. He was my then 4 year old's coach at a community center class and when classes stopped for the summer my son wanted to keep going so we went to the gym and signed up for Ed's class. My son loves Coach Ed and the gym! He always enjoys his classes and is growing stronger every day. I only intended to keep him at the gym through the summer months but then my 8 year old saw the boys team practicing and decided he wanted to do join too! So here we are a year later and my boys really love the gym! We live in south Las Vegas but I drive there because that's where they want to be! Compared to other gyms with the same programs, their cost and class selection can't be beat! Tammy at the front desk is really friendly and always helpful as is the whole staff! They really care about the kids and it shows in everything they do and in all the programs they offer. This summer (2013) we've had the opportunity and need to use the drop in day-camp and my kids really had a great time and look forward to every chance they get to attend the camp and really any other activities they offer. We also did a birthday party there for my youngest when he turned 5-he chose the gym- and all the families that attended had a great time and couldn't believe how much fun it was to have a party at a gym and what's more, the older kids (12-13 years old) in attendance had a blast too. My now 9 year old started with Coach Ed too, it was his choice and he really enjoyed Ed as his teacher. He's now on boys team and likes his new coaches Dave, Nalani and Kyle who always encourage and challenge him.  If you're looking for a gym for your child, Go For It USA is the best place for the perfect balance of fun and structured learning. They have so much more to offer than just gymnastics!

740,"When we first started almost 4 years ago, I thought it would be a great way to keep the kids active and learn self defense.  It turns out much more than I expected, not only is their bodies strong but so is their mind!  They learned life skills like respect, loyalty, discipline, perseverance,  integrity to name a few. The kids have worked their way up in ranks and one made it to a state champion and is working extremely hard to make it to the worlds championships! Both kids are straight A  students and were not when they first started with Rico's.  What the kids have learned is to have goals in life and they must work for it (short or long term)! I am proud of who they are becoming and how they are dedicating themselves to a life of success!I would highly recommend Rico's Martial Arts to any parent!

741,"After checking out other gyms throughout the valley, it was clear that Rico's Martial Arts was where we wanted to be! We chose Mr. Rico not only for the martial arts aspect for teaching self defense but the leadership program he offers. The lessons in life skills, are nothing but superior. Students are taught self defense, respect, self discipline and confidence. Mr. Rico is not only concerned about progress in his program, he takes high interest in his students education.  This was a very wise investment for us and we recommend it to everyone!! Stop by and watch one of the classes, you will not be disappointed !!

743,"Our son was never interested in any sports.  When a friend invited him to an open house at Rico's he really enjoyed it.  For this summer we thought we would give him a few weeks to decide if it was for him.  On his first day of instruction it was clear it meant he fit in somewhere and was welcomed.  Now he's learning respect and honor and his behavior has really improved.  He is not only learning self defense but gaining the confidence that will keep him from being a target to be picked on.  He comes home from school every day with the focus to work on his studies so he can get to class at Rico's Martial Arts.  I could go on and on about the many things our family has gained in such a short time with Ricco's help, but what I love most is how all the instructors and even the parents of all the kids are so pleasant and really make your whole family feel like you are part of something great for all the kids.

It is truly a family. My husband and Iconsider Mr. and Mrs. Rico to be second parents to Jacob over the yearsas in times of trial they have shared in helping us set goals andconsequences for our son and they provided another solid example forhim to follow of what is right and wrong.

746,"A really great traditional Chinese martial arts school. Definitely the most prominent in Las Vegas, as well as the most complete, welcoming, and inclusive. The students range in age from 6 or so to elderly people, and the breadth of available classes ranges from gentle Qigong and Yang Tai Chi Chuan, through more challenging Chen family Tai Chi and Ba Gua Zhang, all the way to the most challenging acrobatic Northern Shaolin and Praying Mantis KungFu. It's not chopsuey kung fu, or one of those stripmall colored belt factories...it's the real deal, and they really do serve the local community, with lion dancing at the New Year, as well as outreach programs and a strong spiritual emphasis at the center of the curriculum. Not just a meathead asskicking school, but I wouldn't recommend you starting any shit with them either.

747,"Funny about Lohan School...I went there from a suggestion of a friend of mine. This place is run by Sifu Steven Baugh and I knew that name...it turned out Sifu my friend in Jr High School's dad. Raul teaches there as well. It's a very welcoming environment. People there are friendly and teach many aspects of Kung Fu. Lohan is a non profit school which made it very appealing because they weren't trying to sell me a 200 dollar outfit or buy weapons in the black market. I loved going to the Spiritual Warrior classes. The community service they do is very admireable. I've seen them on Fox 11 news and doing lion dances during Chinese New Year, they have been to clubs to ward off the evil spirits and promote prosperity and health. I think Sifu is a great spiritual and community leader. This will be good for kids to help build their self esteem and get in shape for the great war with the Outlanders....uh whoops this isn't Mortal Kombat

748,"I have been studying with Sifu Baugh since 2003.  My only complaint is that I didn't find him before 2003.  I have been studying since the 80's, and I have studied with some disreputable teachers.  Sifu teaches: Chen Tai Chi, Yang Tai Chi, Northern and Southern forms of Kung Fu, Praying Mantis, Xing Yi, Ba Qua, and other forms of traditional Kung Fu.  Unlike other teachers and schools I have attended, Sifu Baugh is approachable and humble.  He teaches the majority of the classes, and his only concern is helping you to get better.  He is respected by other martial arts teachers in town, and he even teaches some of them. If you are looking for a traditional Kung Fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors, reasonable monthly fees, no annual contracts, many different styles and classes, no ego, and a place that you can train for the rest of your life, then this is the place to train.

749,"I have been a part of the Lohan School of Shaolin for 4 years now, and it has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When I first heard of the school, my father took me in to watch the kung fu class and when I walked in, I felt this really strong positive energy, and right then and there, I wanted to join. The school is like a second home to me and the students are like another family. If you are looking for a good traditional kung fu school, this is definitely the place to go.

ASU fight song battle. they do this every time i go in, and basically drunken bros try to ""outbid"" one another to hear one song over the other (during the rose bowl, etc, the respective teams are inserted). anyway, i've seen some poor way too drunk fool plop down $100 in effort to have his team song played over another - pretty smart gimmick for the players, pretty crappy for the dude who has to to realize, ""wait, did i really pay $100 to hear a song last night""i think the drink prices are steep here, but it's a fun time and you're getting live entertainment.

They take requests and do the best they can to sing everything they are asked, only once have they turned down one of mine, because they just didn't know it.If you go early between 5-8, they have fantastic drink specials aka happy hour. Beers, wines, wells are 2 bucks, everything else is 3 bucks. Can't beat that :). Also the earlier you go the easier it is to find the seat. Going after 8 it is almost impossible to find a table, and standing room is kind of limited. People some times say they play the same songs every night, and they do, because they know them, people request them all the time, and they are good group singing songs. And you have to admit to be up there playing the piano, drums or guitar and being to play a song on the spot with no music sheets is pretty awesome.

Not exactly a place to mingle as it gets really loud, but if youre with a bunch of people you know you should have a nice time. Last time I went there was on a Tuesday and it was actually kinda busy. It was my friend's 21st bday and he did the whole getting on the stage thing. He tried to dance, but he wasnt that drunk yet. Afterwards someone gave him a 252 which he threw up almost right away. It wasnt chunky, and it wasnt a lot, but rules are rules. One of the bouncers followed him to the bathroom a little later and nicely asked us to leave. I have never been kicked out of a place in such a polite way before. (not that I get kicked out very often) We ended up running into the same bouncer at the Cue Club a few minutes later and he was cool and took a picture with us.All things considered, we had a good time. Don't Stop Believing, Piano Man and YMCA were some of the songs playing, and I'm pretty sure I ordered 3 drinks but only got charged for 2.

756,"FINALLY. I tried coming here one time before and the line was ridiculously long to get in. Now I have a good understanding of why so many people want to come here! It's POPPIN'!!! I wish they had a place like this in San Francisco where there are dueling pianos and drunken college folks who just sing along whether or not they know the lyrics.Cover was $6 I think but well worth it since the drinks are fairly inexpensive (from a city girl standard)...$6-7 roughly. You can request songs to the pianists but they'll really only get to your request if you throw in a few dollars for tip. One lady threw in $20 and her song was automatically played. She even got to sit up there with them. I would definitely come back to the Big Bang when I'm in town next. Bring a few friends, get a table in front (if possible) and enjoy the entertainment.

Two pianos duke it out with classic songs and you can request songs with a tip. Don't think they only play cheesy showtunes. They do at times, and sometimes you can just sit there laughing at grown men belting out every word like they are own stage. Other times they drag unwilling people to stage and make them sing the words. All in all, a good time. Minus the Arizona heat.

Definitely not the scene for people who weren't raised on classic rock. if all you love is R & B and the only songs you know by heart are rap, you're not going to like it here (as much as i do!!!).I'm always stoked to come here and get to sing a little diddy about jack and diane, while together we lament the day the music died and have one last dance with mary jane until the midnight hour when we cried MORE MORE MORE! In the very end we'll put bread in their jars and say ""man, what are you doing here!""The Big Bang is a huge hit, with the entertainment truly making this place. i've come in here by myself, with a large group of people and with just a significant other. it doesn't matter who i'm with, we're all in here to get great drinks and shout great classic memories along with the (VERY) talented pianists... who all also double as drummer and bassistsguitarists. I highly recommend this barrel-of-monkeys type entertainment. but beware! the language gets foul and we all get a little rowdy. and if you didn't understand my paragraph on what gets me so stoked about this place, you're not going to ""get"" why so many people love it here.

So when a friend said she is getting a group together on a Saturday to go check out the Shout House at Westgate I was all for it!We got to the Shout House about 7:30ish, and my friend who has been here before had reserved tables for the group and after been there for while a noticed that that is the way to go, the place fills up pretty quick and turns into standing room only.For me, it was a blast I love the look of a baby grand piano and to have 2 on stage next to each other, man that was hot, and to watch the guys fingers just fly over the keys, yea it was a good night for sure!But they have more than just piano playing going on, they even bust out with the guitar and beat some drums, and this amazing chick comes out and just plays her heart out on the violin, she was great, made playing the violin look cool, maybe I should have played that instead of the flute haha  They have good drink prices and even serve food, service was kind of slow, but she was handling a huge crowd, but I suspect that to be the same size crowd every weekend.The crowd had a great vibe, everyone smiling and singingshouting along. I am a music person so this place was for me, but if you don't like loud music or the neighbor next to you singing along as if she is Adele but really more like Sanjaya , or some impromptu dancing and shouting happening, then this might not be the place for you, but me it was a great time and I will be back!

The wait staff were tremendous and actually let us in out of the cold a little before the restaurant opened.  We were there with an infant which tends to complicate things at most restaurants, but they were well set up and didn't give it a second thought.We tried the bacon and eggs mac and cheese as well as the eggs benedict.  The mac and cheese was made with about 4 kinds of cheese and topped with their homemade bacon (which is amazing) and two perfectly poached eggs.  It was heavy, but delicious.  The eggs benedict was also incredible.  Not too much hollandaise and homemade bacon instead of ham.  The kicker was a homemade biscuit for the base.  It all came together very nicely.Griffintown Cafe was very kid friendly with amazing food and excellent staff.  We couldn't have asked for a better brunch and will definitely be back.

We ate at the bar and we spent a couple of hours lingering after our meal visiting with the staff, the chef and his wife.

773,"Have been here a few times for breakfast and once in the evening, so I'll split the review in to two: Breakfast - while there's always a line up, it's well worth the wait. The place is noisy, but that's just because it's one big space (including all the seating, the bar, and the kitchen) and popular. I don't find it a problem, but if you want a quiet spot to escape the noise, then you don't want to come here.While you're waiting for a table, try to squeeze in at the bar to order a coffee (it's really good here) - it makes the wait that much more bearable.The G Biscuit with bacon is my favourite savoury meal - it's not too big, super tasty, and cooked to perfection. On the sweet side I really like their french toast - nothing too crazy, just solid french toast goodness.Evening - much more chillaxed. I had the burger and pint Wednesday special for $18, and wasn't disappointed. The burger patty is a mix of beef, lamb, and duck, and tastes as good as it sounds! I can't remember what beer they have on tap, but it's good.

774,"Sign me up for a weekly eat here, please Someone Please. Arriving starved after a morning train ride from Ottawa, I was seated on the terrasse. Snuggly wedged into my seat (which was also propping open the door to the restaurant) I got down to brass tacts: bennies and bevies. I ordered absolutely, positively correctly. The house cured wild salmon benny was a perfect blend of salty, sweet, pickled, and smoky flavour. And the mountain of potato mash with bites of onions I could have easily eaten double! Griffintown seems to be a restaurant that enjoys homemaking their wares. Much to my joyful surprise, they also had homemade ginger beer. And yes, it too was delicious. I searched for something wrong with experience, but truthfully, it was just a big breakfast-at-lunch-time love fest.

He played almost the entire time we were in the restaurant. The food was fantastic, in fact probably the best quality food I've had in the city of Goodyear. The hummus was great (and free, thanks to a coupon that came in the mail) as was the warm pita bread. The hummus is a house recipe that is made on site. For dinner we got one of their boards and everything was great. It was a combination of your choices of meat, cheeses and bread that was of the highest quality and tasted fantastic. I also had the wine that was recommended by the waiter, which was a good fit.Gigino's is really a one of a kind place in Goodyear and hopefully they will be around for a long time.

780,"Anyone who lives in Phoenix's west valley knows that our side of the hood isn't exactly, err, bustling with independent local businesses. Everywhere you look it's big box stores and chains, and while many of the employees are lovely and personable, they're just not invested like they are in good old mom and pop shops. Enter Gigino's. Owned by a REAL DEAL Italian dude and his lovely wife, this place has some CRAZY good food. I'm fairly picky when it comes to my eats, so I don't say this lightly -- they made the BEST panini I've ever had in my life. Let me back up and set the stage for you a bit. I came here with my husband on his birthday, intending to have a glass of wine and some tapas -- the valpack coupon offering a free hummus drew me in. We entered this restaurantwine bar, which is nicely decorated and has a variety of fun different seating options (you can eat at the piano!!!), and were surprised to find it fairly empty on a Thursday evening. Happy hour was going on, so we enjoyed some $5 bruschetta, a glass of their house wine special for me, and a big craft beer for the birthday man. The Italian owner, whose name I can't recall, was very attentive and chatty without being overbearing, and when he found out it was my man's birthday, he proceeded to bring us two comp glasses of champagne. Nice! After enjoying our sips and snack, we decided to dive in to the paninis. We ordered two -- one with prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and a few other things I can't recall which was great, and one manchego cheese, some type of delicious meat, fig jam, and pears, grilled on sourdough that was out-freakin-standing. Oh. My. Goodness. Eat this right now. I savored every bite of this panini and told pretty much everyone I know and work with about it. For dessert, we had a pastry with nutella which was also tasty, but didn't compare to the panini. Overall, I'm a huge fan of this place. Great service, authentic people and food, AND locally owned. I sure hope they make it here, because I am looking forward to years of paninis. Mmm!

A wonderful and cozy little wine bar just around the corner from home with a warm and genuine owner-operator staff that are more worried that you have a pleasant experience than giving you a check and the door.

Want to buy a bottle but don't want to get a DUI on the way home  They'll mark your bottle and keep it there for you or recork it for the ride home.

Fantastic wine list great lite bites met the owner and her (willing to work harder than most adults I know) kids.  Loved the piano playing in the back ground.  It is not often in AZ you find this kind of stuff, with out spending an arm and a leg.  In this time of financial uncertainty Christy and her family are making it work.  If you live or are visiting the Goodyear area for Spring training a wedding or what ever reason please check this place out.   It is small businesses like this that keep our country running.My personal thought please leave your kids at home this is very much an adult night out kind of place

784,"I thought it might be odd to write a review about a spiritual spot...but sometimes I feel Macy's is my personal heaven so here goes. For those of you looking to connect deeper with yourself and the world, and want a non committed affiliation, check this place out. Its not your typical church experience- the place is founded on Science of Mind which is NOTTTTTTTTTTT Scientology or even close. If you have seen The Secret, read books by Louise Hay, or hopped on the Power of Now wagon, you understand the basic teachings of The Law of Attraction and changing your thinking, changes your life. Anyways, it is a perfect place to set aside an hour on Sunday to get back to basics. You can believe in any higher power and be cool here. The people are nice, don't corner you and the talk is always relate able to real life.Wishing you all the best on your own journey!

I'm not a religious person but I did come here one other time with my uncle (I took a world religions class and Rick took me here). My first impression is that its such a beautiful church with symbols of various religious icons and a laid back atmosphere. The people seem to genuinely love it here and feel comfortable being in the presence of their pastor() Rev. Mitzi Lynton. She was well spoken, not pushy and not saying ""God this and Jesus that"". She told the congregation ,my family, to take a deep breath and say your own prayer for him as he was a father,husband, brother, grandfather, brother-in-law, father-in-law etc...you get the idea. I found that t o be super. They put up a few appetizers with water, tea and wine and gave our family room to mingle and greet eachother etc..The girls who helped were on top of everything! They respect one anothers  faith and belief system. I definately think i will be going back and checking out a real service. Thanks to my uncles friends who helped with everything from food, song choices, flowers and loving support.

I have attended on a regular basis and greatly enjoy my time and experience here on the Sundays that I am able to attend. They are open and accepting of all people. There are different lifestyle's that I don't necessarily agree with but it is not my place to judge but to treat with respect and dignity that each human being deserves. This is what I see here. Rev Michelle is a class act and a genuine caring person. Life is to short to condem others and that does not be occur here.

Not only did Psycho Jock pull it off, they did it in a very short time frame. John, one of the owners, actually came all the way down to our office (a 45-60 minute drive) on a Saturday to bring us samples. Then, one of the employees met me half way to deliver the shirts. Great customer service plus high quality work. I'm a fan.

790,"Great experience with Psycho Jock on my low volume order. They make good on the customer service claim that they service ""needs as small as 1 hat, to 5,000 shirts"", as I only wanted two shirts done, and they treated me as if I was getting 200 hundred. Neal is awesome. He listened to what I was looking for and his communication was fast and professional. The whole thing, from first communication to finish was done in around a week, which met our extremely tight deadlines. I had never had embroidery of our logo done, and Neal created sew-outs in two sizes so I could pick the best one for my project. We selected the one that met our needs, and the final product turned out great. Very proud of the shirts that Psycho Jock created for us. Can't wait for our next trade show when I can show them off. Hoping we can find some more stuff to do and come back to Psycho Jock.

He's fantastic, down to earth, and not at all pretentious as some yarn store employeesowners seem to be.I especially love how many great LOCAL yarn lines and indie dyers that Chris stocks.

I've also just walked in and asked for help with a pattern before.

He's also helped walk me through what kind of yarn would be good for different products and even helped me fix a crochet afghan that was literally falling apart at the seams!

827,"I have been a subscriber to the Pittsburgh Opera for 5 years.  I have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably New York City and Sidney, and I feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in Pittsburgh.  The season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  The Benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  I also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the Pittsburgh Opera.

It's an impressive and well maintained building that provides both locals and out-of-towners with a good impression of the city. The first time at the center, I lived in NC and was attending a big work event here. I was very impressed by the architecture of the center but sadly wasn't in an area where I could see beautiful views of the city. After moving to Pittsburgh, I came for the annual home show and auto show. Though I liked both shows, the auto show was a bit more impressive. I hear that the home and garden show is a must-attend! Finally, I came here for the Boden liquidation sale yesterday. The views from the line to enter (where I sat for a looong time) were absolutely stunning! The section of the center overlooked the river and the North Shore with a bridge flanking both sides of the view. I didn't mind the wait just because I could admire the view. I look forward to coming back for the home and garden and auto shows in 2014!

We were given the university rate for the room due to my father's affiliation with Pitt, and that made a good deal even better.

830,"My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon.  It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so we wanted something close to him.  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay.  We are very, very, well traveled, and are extremely selective about where we stay.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back.  In fact we tried, but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(The location is perfect, and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street.  You don't even need a car.  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings, so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that).  The front desk person was sweet and friendly.  Not only did he check us in immediately, he gave us a ""breakfast bag"" full of muffins, juices, and granola bars!  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite, even tho we only booked a studio.   Well, when we got into our room, not only was it a suite, but it was a 2 BR suite!  I couldn't believe it.  It was bigger than our apartment back home.  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer - like a month!The suite had a giant flat screen TV, a big dining area, with room service menu, free wi-fi, and super comfy furniture.  The bed was to die for.  The only thing that didn't go was the older, un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures, but it really didn't bother us at all, because the shower water pressure was great.  There is ample parking out back, and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteous.When we checked out, they were renovating the main office, so it's nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve.  Checkout took less than 30 seconds.  I handed her my key, and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill, since I used my credit card to book.  Everything went so smoothly, and the staff was so wonderful.  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat!

831,"When you first drive up to Shadyside you don't expect much, but we were very much happy with what we got.  The parking lot does have a steep driveway but not too bad.  We went to the lobby and we were met by two ladies who immediately offer us water and cookies. Before leaving the lobby we were given a bag for a Sunday breakfast.  In the bag, bottle of orange juice, apple juice, two small muffins, two granola bars and mints.  The room we were put in look like a small  apartment.  Living roomdinning area and kitchen.  It also had two separate bedrooms, one was a single and the other was full.  This place was very clean and comfortable.This is my second time in Pittsburgh, the first time we stayed in a hotel, we had to pay for parking, go to an elevator to take us up to the lobby and take another elevator to get to our room and had to pay for WI-Fi.

A few years ago the rooms were rundown but since they have renovated and the rooms couldn't be better.  A hotel doesn't give you that much room - you literally have your our own apartment.  I was there last week because a family member died.  We were having relatives visit us at Shadyside Inn and the staff went out of their way to deliver chairs to our rooms.  Our rooms were cleaned every day and there are very few places that allow dogs - and they do!  Their prices are reasonable and I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in PA.  Thank you Shadyside!

836,"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the ""hookup"" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!

Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.

838,"My wife booked my son and I for a fatherSon weekend to the GiantsPanthers game. I had no idea a Holiday Inn could be so nice. It offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling. The decor, room, location were all 5 stars! The front desk and valet parking were top notch! I needed to charge my phone and iPad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it. After we were done he parked it again with a smile.We will absolutely be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay!
",others
839,"Perfect location with a warm friendly staff.  What more could you ask for  Everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful.  Our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years.  When we mentioned we were in Charlotte for a sick relative, kids in tow, and that it was our anniversary, they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room.  If you book through their website, the prices are very reasonable.

840,"Probably not one of my more timely reviews...St. Mary's apparently began its life as the chapel of an orphanage (which itself is no longer standing).  Now it is just the chapel, which is used for weddings - I suppose other events could take place there as well, but weddings are far and away the most popular event at the chapel.Take note of that if you plan to get married there (as we did).  We went in late January and they were booked through August.  This means that every possible slot was filled - in two-hour increments - more than seven months in advance.  In other words, plan ahead.As luck would have it, browsing one page at a time, we managed to find a single slot that had been canceled, so we grabbed it, and that lone factor is what sealed our wedding date (a mere two months from our engagement date, rather less than that from the time we went to find a venue).  But we are very glad it did, because the location itself rocks.Nestled just outside the 277 loop, on the grounds of Thompson Park (also the site of the Vietnam Veterans memorial), the chapel and the park offers a nice respite from the busy-ness of Uptown while being close to everything.  The trees provide great cover, so you barely know you are so close to the city, and inside it is like you have stepped back in time.  You can even have your organist play a harpsichord (if they are able).Since our wedding party was intimate - just the immediate family - we had the whole group entirely on the raised dais, which provided a nice treat to everyone, rather than scattering them in the pews, which would have separated everyone far too much (for larger parties, it would certainly be fine).  Big thumbs up.

I have never been to New Orleans, and because of Katrina, I probably  won't for awhile, but I imagine that this is a pretty good joint even by looziana standards.

846,"I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also deliciousFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, ""Slow down, it's not going anywhere!"" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.

847,"Food:  Fried Oysters were nice and crispy on the outside and delightfully gooey on the inside.. The perfect spice for both the oysters and the shrimp.  On the main course... Lay down a bed of rice, throw some ""jerk like"" chicken and two different kinds of red bean delicousness and BAM... You are set!   Now, I like my food to have a KICK but this was, what I would call, a controlled KICK.  Just enough spice to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more.  You could always add some more Louisiana hot sauce if you wanted.  Then, to top it off.... bread pudding.. Oh Lordy Lord Lord, the bread pudding.. SOOOOOooo good.  I would go back just for the bread pudding.  AtmosphereStaff:  Bo, the bartender made a mean Hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful.  Everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed.  The upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy touch.  Overall, simply wonderful.  Please give it a try.. You wont regret it.   Enjoy-Ian M.

852,"I'm pretty particular about 'where' i see shows.  A crappy venue can kill a good artist and put up a good fight against a great one.Fortunately, The Rhythm Room needn't worry about quashing the entertainment value of one of their nationally touring acts.  And the RR really does get some of the best independent acts on tour.  For artists worthy of smallish venues, this place should be as legendary as the Whiskey in Hollywood, but unfortunately, its located on, like the kiddie ride portion of Los Angeles, central Phoenix.For a venue, they have really smokin deals on alcohol, like PBR for $2.50.  Considering that you couldn't get that deal ANYWHERE playing live music, i consider it a humongous bargain.  They have a smoking patio that you can still hear the music during those 5 mins, and the venue is easy to get in and out of.It DOES tend to get crowded once the main act is on, especially near the bar, but I've never waited more than a couple of minutes for a drink and i can always find a good view of the stage.When acts like Bob Schneider come around, the place is ROWDY.  Indie acts like VHS or Beta and Midlake are near priceless to see in such a small joint.and sometimes shows that pique too much interest will be moved to their big cousin Marquee.

853,"Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.

For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!

854,"I have yet to find a better blues, jump blues, swing, etc... venue in Phoenix.So, on the Phoenix scale of music venues it gets 5 stars.Yes, it's a dive. Which is a good thing.  No pretentious personalities at the Rhythm Room. Cheep beer, a decent dance floor, decent sound and great music are all that really matter.  Rhythm Room has them all.  It kinda reminds me of the Foothill (R.I.P.) in Long Beach, CA. And that's a good thing. I miss the Foothill dearly.Also, what is possibly the best show (Mates of State), out of hundreds I've ever seen in many cities across the U.S.,  was at the Rhythm Room.

855,"This place has a great little vibe and fantastic music. I have to admit, I'm not very hip when it comes to the Blues but I definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance. It was a nice change to look into the crowd and see 21-year-old college students, to middle age moms, to retired couples all getting down and dancing. You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people, from every color of the rainbow, and all ages, just enjoying the music. The few times I've been there have been quite an experience, and I always leave very happy to have found a place like this in Phoenix. The drinks are super cheap, the sound is good, and the music is wonderful!

856,"The Rhythm Room was the first blues bar I visited when I moved here to Arizona. I randomly showed up for their fall music festival.  I saw so many great local acts that I had no idea existed! And It was my first introduction to Big Pete Pearson.  That guy puts on a GREAT show and always interacts with the crowd and will talk to any random bar patron who wants to praise his performance or just talk music. The RR is also really good about showcasing newer bands from all over the country of all genres. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are awesome and always show ample cleavage. The crowd on any given night ranges from the young hipsters to the AARP crowd who still dress up for a night on the town with cocktails and dancing. There is no pretension here.  I love this place and everytime I go, I wonder why I've been away for so long.

861,"I went here years ago when I was young and enjoyed dancing. I always felt sort of exposed the way the seating was. There is that long row of bar stools that makes you feel on display. Now I prefer listening to music rather than dancing to it (except at home where I often break into dance for no reason whatsoever.) So now I say I love you Rhythm Room. You make me feel like Goldilocks except without the long walk in the woods and home burglary part. You are not to hot, not to cold, you are just right. Not to big, not to small, again... you got it right. And I haven't even broken a bar stool yet. Nor have I fallen asleep while at the Rhythm Room. I am done with the young hip scene I use to visit at the Emerald Lounge, before it was turned into a Starbucks. If I go someplace like that now it always seems too loud and my personal space always feels violated. I still feel to young for the lounge act at Scottsdale's blahblahblah so where do I fit in Where do I fit in Where can I go for good music and not stand out like a, well, just not stand out. I dislike big crowds and arenas. Small venues are fine if you are not the only audience member and will be missed if you need to get up to pee.  The beer is cold but my friends who prefer a gin and tonic can also be taken care of. The people who work there are nice, no attitude, and are actually very cool. If it gets a little crowded or if you feel like chatting someone up they have a patio. Finally I have found a place where I can blend in and listen to the music I love. Bowerbirds, check. St. Vincent, check. Now, if you could just book Grizzly Bear it would be true love and I would live happily ever after.

862,"Woah, this place is great!  On my first visit I walked in and was immediately greeted by 4 different ""hello""'s, ""welcome""'s, and smiling faces.  What a warm welcome right off the bat.It was a little hard to find, but once you find it, you will be so glad you did.  Their food is amazing!  I have been twice now and have had their pork chops, hot links, and chicken wings, all were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and tasted excellent!  I was a bit hesitant with the hot links, as often they come way too greasy for my taste, but these were grilled to perfection and not overly greasy.  I was very impressed.  I have also tried their dirty rice (spicy and dirty with ground beef, great!), black eyed peas, and their french fries.  The fries were just fries, but seasoned well.... everything else was spot on.  I really enjoyed their dirty rice.  I've had a lot of different types of dirty rice, and this was very unique and very tasty.Their chicken deserves its own paragraph here.  Seriously.  I order their fried chicken ""not battered"", so they basically season the chicken and drop it in the deep fryer.  OMFG.  I've eaten my share of fried chicken, but their chicken, by far, is better than anything I have ever eaten..... easy.  In fact, my mouth is literally watering as I type this.  Go, eat their chicken. The environment was nice... low light, dark decor, great old school tunes being spun by a dj on the 1's and 2's. Don't worry, if you don't eat wheat or gluten, just tell them and they will make sure your meal is made without, no issues here.  Very accommodating.

863,"This place had the most AMAZING meatloaf, fried chicken, and mac & cheese. I also ordered a side of greens which were good but a little too salty for me. I don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because I know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor, but I had this feeling that Bobby C's would make it perfectly. I wasn't disappointed. It had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits. The fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant I've been to. It was so juicy and to die for. The mac and cheese was another hit. Next time I'm going to order the mashed potatoes and gravy as well! The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was loungy with great old school tunes being played on their nice sound system.

870,"Le Tigre is a hidden gem. I found out about it through a friend who pointed it out to me when I first arrived in town. He told me David Lynch famously said this is the ""best bar in Madison."" What's most awesome about Le Tigre are the bartenders. The owner has owned three iterations of the bar since the 50s, and his son bartends most of the time. His son is one of the nicest, most genial, and quickest bartenders you'll find in town. The bar attracts many locals and regulars who come in just to talk with him. This is another place you can feel safe coming to if you feel like having a drink on your own (and as a woman, it can be difficult to find such places).I don't want to ruin the suprise of Le Tigre's decor too much, but if you are a lover of kitsch, you'll love Le Tigre. The bar also has a jukebox filled with songs that have been in it since the owner opened the bar in another location in the 50s. Some notes: you can't swear in the bar. If you have a potty mouth and need to exercise it, go to another bar. Le Tigre also is cash-only, and there is no ATM, because the owner doesn't feel safe having one, so if you forget cash, you've got a bit of a haul to an ATM. Also, don't expect draught beers; you can only get beer in bottles here, though there is also a full bar.This is a local's bar, an oddity, a place you go to for a kick. It is not a  bar that caters to the jet set.

871,"I feel like saying that this bar is a reported favorite of David Lynch should be review enough, but I'll try to gussy it up with usefulness or some such thing.  The odd location in a strip mall with an unassuming storefront seems just right for some reason.  As do the numerous tigers, tiger prints, and tiger carpet which lend themselves to the name.  The bartender was friendly, the atmosphere cozy, and the music classic.  Drinks were good and cheap.  A decently sized (and poured) Tanqueray and tonic and a Spotted Cow will set you back $8.  Other than the free flowing popcorn there's no food, no credit cards, and allegedly no swearing, though I did manage to catch myself saying ""ass"" and I didn't even notice I'd said ""bitchass bitch"" and nobody tossed me out on my can.

872,"Fun fact: all of the tiger decor is DONATED! My husband and I have been wanting to go here for a long time, mostly because of the camp factor. It seemed really cheesy and fun. Turns out, it is AMAZING. Here is the low-down of why I love this place. Atmosphere - Outside of the very obvious and corny tiger decor, this is the kind of place you could come to in a cocktail dress or jeans and a t-shirt and fit in (I know because we saw that exact combination while we were there). If you stay for more than a few drinks, you might forget where you are or what time of day it is because it is quite dark inside. Other than than, it is a standard townie bar dressed to the nines, complete with obligatory free, stale popcorn. There is ample parking, but you might not want to drive (see Drinks)Drinks - I got a Tom Collins. My husband got a Manhattan. These are the types of drinks you should order at this place. They make a fabulous, no frills, strong mixed drink. As it should be. This is Wisconsin, after all.Staff - I've only ever been there when a younger man was bartending, but he was fabulous. He was chatty and friendly without being annoying. And he had a sense of humor about his white shirt and bow tie. Take home - Le Tigre is not only special because of it's camp and decor. It is fabulous because they put some crimson lipsick on tired, old hole in the wall and made her look like Scarlet Johansson.

SO we said lets do it!  When we arrived we were the only patrons in the place.. It was pretty dark inside, but not dark enough to hide all the amazing TIGER photos, paintings, furniture, and Real Taxidermfied Tigers!  The bartenderowner was amazing, he looked like AL from HAPPY DAYS!Just like this... http:the701level.files.wordpress.com2010126a0105349ca980970c011571508c8b970b-320wi.jpg so you can Imagine my excitement. He was super nice and just looked like something out of a gangster movie!  You know like the guy who knows everything! The drinks were cheap, so you could get a round for 5 people under 20 bucks!  Which is amazing and YEP you guessed it I was drinking TIGER beers!The jukebox was out of this world, 7 plays for a dollar and all the records were old and scratchy.  Which gave the place a really wonderful vibe. Songs by Louis Armstrong, Elvis, Frank Sinatra, and Tina Turner were the soundtrack to our amazing and very memorable night!So the next time someone wants to take you to a Bar in a Strip Mall you better hope it's Tiger themed and in Madison!

879,"once per 'season' (yes I know phoenix doesn't have seasons, just hot and less hot, yet i love it) they have a super art walk.  There are street performers, free food, radio stations.  Most galleries have wine to sample.  Makes for a good time. Not to mention some amazing artwork.  I have been known to window shop on a somewhat crooked walk home from the bars, its even better when you get to go in!

880,"Kind of like a warm, outdoor version of the National Gallery in DC.  I would even be willing to say you'll see more interesting collections than what is housed at our DC gallery.There's plenty of Southwestern scenes of Native Americans and the Grand Canyon, but I did manage to admire 2 pricey Picassos, and multiple paintings of faraway landscapes.  The galleries on Main St are amazing and have an ecletic collection.

881,"A must do on Thursday evening if you're a tourist. Tons of art galleries feature lots of Native American culture, sculptures, jewelry and some of the galleries have wine! Expensive- but a great way to appreciate art. If you're staying at a local hotel, find a golf cart driver. They work off tips!

884,"For my girlfriend's birthday I took her to Mary Elaine's, which is a super fancy French restaraunt in Scottsdale, AZ. My brother has worked there for a few years now, and he's been suggesting that we experience it. The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant, addressing us by name and taking a moment to replace my girlfriend's blue napkin with a black one to match her dress. They even brought over a small stool for me to set my digital camera on. The restaraunt is situated on the top floor of the Phoenician Resort and every seat at Mary Elaine's has a spectacular view of the valley.We let the chef prepare a tasting menu for us, and their Sommelier (wine expert) paired wines with many of the tastings. I will have to consult with my brother to fully explain the dishes served, but the food was so fine tuned to perfection that I can not imagine improvement. I HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE eat at Mary Elaine's at least once, as it is truly the finest experience in dining I can imagine.I posted images of our food here.  http:www.secret.strandland.comMaryElaines

885,"[I can't believe that I am the second person to review this restaurant. I may be the last; Mary Elaine's closes its doors for good sometime this month (Feb 2008). Perhaps I am the second person because a proper dinner for two (and I mean that that includes a _real_ selection from the best wine list in the city) will cost you $700 to $800, easily the cost of a coach ticket to Paris for the real thing. But make your reservations in advance. Dinner at Guy Savoy must be planned 4 to 6 weeks ahead. In case you don't realize it by the time you finish this one, I _AM_ a food snob.I feel a very heavy burden here because Mary Elaine's has stood for everything I have hoped for in the finest of service and detailed preparation in a dining experience since I was a member of the Plaza Club, also now defunct. That I could presume to review this establishment and the professionals who take each and every part of their job as their personal quest in life is totally ludicrous. Instead of a review, I can at best present some of my fondest memories of this wonderful place. OK, Now that I have set the bar high enough for myself, let me begin.]I can't remember if the team that comprises the army of staff that will serve you at front of house numbers 12 or 21 people, but by the time your dinner is over, you will have had a dinner to remember for the rest of your life.Take your pick from one of two seatings, 6 to 6:45 or 8:30 to 9:15. Give the reservationist every last detail of your preferences. Some of my favorite requests: (1) seat me as far away from that wailing wanna-be Lisa Addeo who thinks she can replace Nancy Gee -- she's still singing the exact same songs in the exact same order she was eight years ago in the lobby. If I have to hear her make those Time-to-Say-Goodbye octave leaps one more effing time, I'm going to kill myself; (2) give us relaxed timing on the courses, we're in no rush; (3) my guest does not drink alcohol and is from Iran, find a formal drink for her that she will appreciate; (4) my guest loves Chateaubriand, could you scrape some upAmong my most memorable experiences:The time Todd (manager) knowing my love of late 80's California cabs found a bottle of '88 Heitz Martha's Vineyard and surprised me for my birthday dinner.The time my guest surprised me by calling in and requested hot sourdough for my bread choice knowing how much I love it.The time our party sat at Chef's table in the kitchen and I watched first hand the quietest kitchen you can possibly imagine.The bottle of '62 Chateau Gran Larose that left my mouth black and from which I was still drunk the next day.My one and only ever sliver of Louis XIV cognac at $750 a slice.The way Nancy Gee used to sing Angel Eyes, my favorite.The time Sommelier Paul introduced me to the rasiney sweet pleasure of Lusteau Emilin cherry.Mary Elaine's took pride in finding the most extravagant yet excellent ingredients in the entire world. It would not be uncommon for the special to include some extremely rare fish that had been flown in that afternoon. The wine list boasted 5000 bottles. Where else could you splurge on a $10,000 bottle of champagne (The answer is Etienne's Different Point of View at Pointe Tapatillo Cliffs.) What if you feel like having a '60's bottle of Lafite Rothschild Paul and his staff were always happy to oblige.I'm talking about the subtleties of food preparation such that a single course may have but six or seven bites, but each of those is a symphony of tastes that overwhelms the senses. On my last visit, the sauce chefs had perfected their entries to each course to such an extent that their excellence sometimes overshadowed the main ingredients themselves.It was fun to gulp my entire glass of water to see how many seconds it would take to be noticed and refilled (no more than 15).Mary Elaine's celebrated what might be called a sacred relationship between a host and his guest. You will be missed.

886,"We've been going to Mary Elaine's since it made its debut years ago, and it has never let us down. When it closes its doors April 5th, it will be the end of an era. I agree with Mike's comments and remember well the Plaza Club, but Mary Elaine's has always been in a league of its own.Greg, the Master Sommelier, became a friend through the years and never failed to introduce us to exquisite wines that he would often set aside for us, or give us a call when something special arrived so we'd be sure to make a reservation.The Chef's Table, Todd, Greg, Nancy Gee -- we still miss her and we'll continue to miss them all.  The last I knew years ago when Todd departed, he was going to launch a restaurant somewhere on Central. Does anybody know if he's still in town and was his then-new venture successful. I was surprised and a bit disappointed that Mary Elaine's is closing with a whimper. I thought perhaps one final blow-out on April 5th would have been a wonderful way to bid an appropriate farewell to a grand lady.Formal, elegant dining is clearly on the wane, and while there are many excellent restaurants in the greater Phoenix-Scottsdale area, Mary Elaine's will always stand alone. It will be missed.

887,"Mary Elaine's was like nothing my boyfriend and I had ever done. It's not really our style, but we had a great time, nonetheless. The service was, of course, very good. I thought it would be too stuffy for our tastes and that I'd feel out of place, but this did not happen. As a matter of fact, after our server warmed up to us, we had a great back-and-forth... same goes for our backserver, who we came to call the Bread-Pusher, because the bread is incredibly addicting.I had the tasting menu, and other than the rabbit, it was awesome. I didn't like the rabbit not because of how it was prepared though, I just don't like rabbit. Too cute and fuzzy.Our server brought us some great wine pairings that were not on the menu and included what we dubbed the ""adult"" framboise... so delicious. It was a cherry sparkling wine  and tasted amazing with chocolate.The whole night was opulence perfected. I will probably never eat here again (oh, except for that whole gift certificate thing) especially because it's closing, but it was fantastic and really a wonderful place to take someone if you need to either impress them or if you're apologizing for something you really, really screwed up.

888,"Uber-fancy French restaurant in Scottdale! 55 Thanks to AJ and J, we got a chance to dine and wine there last year! It is a super nice french restaurant in Phoenician Resort. My first fancy french dining experience! :) All four of us had the tasting menu that evening with great Ridge wine. The tasting mene has small portion but amazing food. As expected, it took us ~4 hours to get done with the dinner. It was the only drawback J could come up with... I think that was perfectly fine for me since we are dining in a FRENCH restaurant. Just enjoy the process! I would definitely go there again.

889,"Ever wander around, trying to find the perfect place to have dinner, overwhelmed with options and unsure how to pick Well, we trekked to Old Montreal and perused probably ten menus of all different restaurants to inform our dinner location decision. By the time we found Jardin Nelson we were hungry and getting punchy. I looked to the back and saw the outdoor patio and large canvas coverings and said ""oooohh, let's go here!"" We were led to a quaint table at the back, a jazz band playing lovely music. The greenery and flowers hang all over the place and the whole atmosphere is warm and inviting. Our server was super nice, friendly, and courteous.I got the leek soup special. It was creamy, savory, a perfect soup. I got the veggie crepe for dinner and gobbled every bit. It was so delicious. For dessert we had the cheesecake crepe and it was heaven. You have to get this thing. Topped with graham crackers and strawberries, totally decadent.Exquisite dining experience from top to bottom. Would return anytime and recommend to anyone.

890,"My husband and I were big fans of this place, not only for the great food, service, and jazz but for the experience as a whole. We sat outside in the garden (after a 10 minute wait for a  late dinner on a Friday night) and marveled at the design of the place. The giant, umbrella-like contraptions probably allow for outdoor seating when it rains and made you feel like you were sitting under giant flowers. The south wall and the foliage definitely made us feel like we were in a garden. The sounds of a jazz quartet wafting through a fresh summer night definitely capped a most romantic evening.Now the food: we started with the Estivale salad (intricately prepared mixing refreshing fruit and vegetables together in perfect balance - one of the best salads we've ever had) and for our main course, had the charcutiere pizza and the saddle of rabbit crepe. The pizza was amazing - thin crust with the tastiest meats on there! The crepe was also very tasty but difficult to isolate all ingredients within (no big deal).For dessert, we shared the pouding chomeur and omg was it incredible. It was very sweet (because of the high quality pure maple syrup) and the vanilla ice cream balanced that perfectly.One of the things I really liked seeing was that on the comment card, there was a question for rating pricequality ratio. Indeed, this place had an excellent pricequality ratio! They could easily charge more, for the setting, for the jazz, for the food but they don't. Very respectable!For a perfect romantic summer evening, this is it! Highly recommended. We would totally go back.
",others
891,"To be honest, we stumbled across this place almost by accident, and to top it off, we almost missed the best part about the restaurant!  There is a patio situated right onto Place Jacques Cartier, however there is an open section behind the restaurant, where a jazz quartet was playing.  The food was really good.  My wife had a crepe, my sister also had a crepe (not the same kind of course), while I enjoyed an ""Italian"" pizza, which I know as a Margarita pizza.  We absolutely loved the atmosphere and sitting outside on a hot and humid Montreal evening, drinking wine, listening to live jazz  and eating great French food made this a real highlight of our trip.

892,"Jardin Nelson is fantastic for several reasons, the first of which is that it's one of the cheaper joints in vieux-Montreal.It was hot on the sun-baked cobblestone main path and I was aching to sit and enjoy a french style brunch and JN delivered beautifully. We sat in the back garden, and we were instantly cooled by the shade and breeze the architecture of the inner eaterie. It's beautiful, with lots of garden plants and stone walls, well lit and your meal is accompanied by jazz music (sometimes live as when I went!).The waitresses are cute and friendly, and can obv accommodate if you only speak english. The menu is somewhat sparse, but what's on there is made with a delicate and professional touch; all of our food was top notch and delicious. I had the house crepe, a friend had the rabbit and another the scallopene. We relaxed and enjoyed the meal and the scenery and heartily recommend the jardin Nelson to both tourists and locals alike. Prices are btwn $15-25person.

893,"Very pretty place. You're kind of outdoors but with a tent like ceiling with jazz playing.

I should have gotten what my friend had...the egg dish...which looked like it was in a casserole...MMmmmI was eying some guy who got a HUGE French onion soup. It looked like twice the normal size. Should have gotten one. Get that French Onion Soup!!!

894,"One of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had. It's a building constructed around a courtyard, with wind sail overhangs that protect you from the elements inside. So basically, your entirely outside, and if it's raining it's quite the show. Rain funnels down the sails into large glass columns. Hard to explain, but VERY cool. Food was above average, but set amidst all of the tourist attraction area, it's more than what you'd expect. When I'm back in Montreal, I'm going back!

895,"Our visit to this wonderland of cheese was quite possibly the highlight of my friends' and my recent visit to Montreal. Even if the food had been terrible, the scenic brick courtyard with its lush, flowering planters, live jazz band, and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable. But luckily, the dinner was great too!We tried the brie, pesto, and pine nut fondue as an appetizer, which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes, and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd. A smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled Forestiere, the vegetable and goat cheese, the apple-bacon, and the duck. At about $15-$20 a plate, we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality. For dessert, we sampled the ""pudding chomeur,"" a Quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey, sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious, though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion, even between the four of us!The service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were seated within ten minutes. Our dry-witted French waiter was a delight, suggesting that a hungry member of our party ""start with one crepe, and then if you're really still hungry I may bring you another,"" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course. English menus are printed on the reverse of the French, for visiting anglophones. Overall - great decor, food, ambiance, and service. We'll be returning if we're ever in Old Town Montreal again!

896,"I adore the Jardin Nelson. Not only is the location stunning, being surrounded by historical buildings just off Place Jacques Cartier in Old Montreal, but the atmosphere in this indooroutdoor restaurant can't be beat.The largest part of the restaurant and most well known is their big terasse (can you call it that when it's more than 34 of the restaurant) with huge parasols in case it rains. Sit under the sun or the stars while eating perfectly cooked meal or dessert crepes, while sipping on a glass of fine wine.Jardin Nelson is perfect for a romantic night out, especially when the jazz band is playing!

897,"I went to Jardin Nelson on a Friday at lunch.  There can be a bit of line, but the wait wasn't too bad.This place is worth the visit for the ambiance alone! A beautiful courtyard patio with canopies and, trees and flowers and a jazz combo played in the not so background.We shared the nachos ($15) for starters and they were very yummy and cheesy.  My father kept commenting on the cranberry salsa.  My mother started with the French Onion Soup and said it was the best she had ever had. I had the UnBeetable salad and found it filling and delicious. I also ordered a 16 oz pitcher of White Sangria.  It was GREAT!  So yummy on a warm afternoon and great to share with a friend.My 3-year-old was nicely welcomed and given crayons and a paper.  She had the pancakes (other choices for kids were limited to pasta or pizza). A place I will return to.

898,"Stunning decor, live jazz music, and delicious brunch fare. This is absolutely one of my favourite brunch spots.This restaurant is the perfect marriage between outdoor and indoor dining. The decor is simply stunning - the unusual giant umbrellas, the potted plants and flowers, and the exposed brick create a whimsical and romantic environment.To eat I had the bacon breakfast crepe. It was heavenly! The crepe batter is much thicker than the expected paper-thin variety, but it definitely works. It's still light and soft, and the hint of sweetness works so well with the salty bacon and savoury cheese and eggs. Just writing this review makes my stomach growl.If you're looking for a great brunch spot in Old Montreal definitely check this place out!

903,"Upstairs is Montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the city's local gems. Its a small and intimate, a perfect spot for any date and a fun way to spend an evening sipping on drinks, grabbing a bite, and listening to some of the best live music in the area.  Joel Giberovitch opened this neat little jazz joint nearly 20 years ago, which has gained a notable amount of popularity, especially in the last decade. His inspirations from his past  trips to legendary New York jazz are an obvious influence in the makeup of his decor, which include wooden panels, brick walls, a lengthy yet cozy bar, and classy linens draping each table. If that doesn't establish the mood, I don't know what does. Seating is tight of course, but group dining is very possible here; I would highly recommend reservations.Though it's been touted as a fun lunch spot, I'm more of a fan during their showcase nights which happen every Friday and Saturday. There is usually a cover charge before midnight, which was about $5 last time I checked. Groups of 4 or more are almost guaranteed a wait, but if you don't listen to jazz often, then take it like a champ and wait it out.If the music isn't worth it (but of course it is), then consider the food and the drinks. Much of the menu is distinctly American, with quite few dishes named after notable states in the South, the birth place of jazz. Another portion of the menu is tapas, which is more bar food (nachos, quesadillas, fries, etc.) than they are classic Spanish small plates. I've enjoyed their food overall, as I've had good results with their pappardelle verona, their New Orleans filet mignon, and their array of tasty burgers. Try any of their martinis or get a wine to be paired with the food.Then of course there's the music. Live jazz doesn't have to be during Montreal Jazz Festival, it can be had here on a much more casual level. The music has always taken precedence and has been a treat every time. I could probably not even eat anything and just sit to enjoy the performances, which vary from a wide range of local and visiting musicians.I think very highly of this place and hope it continues to do well. I haven't gone to Montreal as often lately and want Upstairs to keep the drinks flowing and the music going. If only I could write their name upside down (see pics for reference).

906,"Fabulous place.They have a packed calendar full of local jazz bands, and plenty of them are the real deal. Doesn't matter what your age is or how you feel about jazz music, you will enjoy the evening's performance because they're always top-notch.The room does tend to get very stuffy and warm, though, so allow yourself some time to get used to the difference in temperature inside (especially nowadays when the thermometer's beginning to dip). I can't complain about the food: Lots of tasty tapas (the Ceviche, Prosciutto, and Gambas are must-tries), a great Scotch selection, and of course, local beers. If you get there while an act has already started their set, sit outside if it's not too cold. You still get to enjoy the music and the food without having to pay for the cover (or suffering the heat).

907,"This place is listed in several places as one of the best jazz clubs in Canada, and specifically in Montreal.  Since Montreal has possibly one of the best jazz scenes in the world, that's high praise.  I can see why.While the music may not always be jazz, the club is a great venue.  Its small and intimate, with good acoustics.  Make sure you check the calendar, as the bands can be eclectic.  And you may want to make reservations.  Finally, expect a cover charge ($11 and well worth it).The doorman was great.  There wasn't any more room for a show and, instead of simply telling us to beat feet as many would, he recommended a later show and reservations in the future.  We came back for the later show and he seated us at the side bar.  After the set, he seated us (party of two) in a booth for the late set.  While the house wasn't full for the late show, it was still greatly appreciated.Great staff, great venue, great music.  I can't recommend it enough.

Let's put it this way, I'm a cheap bastard when it comes to haircuts but I can guarantee that you will never find me in a Supercuts again! My entire experience blows every haircut I have ever had out of the water. I love the fact that I showed up after scheduling an appointment the previous day and there was no waiting around. The stylist name I regret can't remember from two days ago but I told her straight up, ""I'm giving you full latitude to do what you think is right for me."" I was not disappointed with how nice of a job she did. She asked the right questions and I could hold a good conversation with her.

Modern often gets bad press because of their rather expensive prices but service like this is worth every penny!  The only downside to this salon is that they only accept gratuity via cash or check.

I shed my clothes and slipped under the covers of the warmed massage table. David knocked and came in and began what I now refer to as one of the best massages I have ever had in my life.

Lana from Hearst Tower Modern has been the only one with a combination of skill and patience to really understand the method to the madness that is my ""chia pet""-esque head.

922,"I was in town for a wedding this past weekend. I forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair, and when I say heavy duty equipment I really mean it. My hair is long, thick, and curly. So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel. When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime. She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use. Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don't usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I've ever had anyone ""understand"" my hair. She didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing. I wish I could have taken her back home to DC, but she suggested a really good stylist in this area. :)

923,"Don't let the 80s logo scare you off. I had a really great haircut here for really cheap - just $35! I made an appointment without asking about pricing because I was in desperate need of a haircut. The stylist spent a long time talking to me about what I wanted, how I style my hair, how much time I spend and what products I use. As she was cutting my hair, she gave me lots of tips on styling. In the end, I came out with one of the best haircuts I ever had.Add in the wine, excellent head massage, and makeup touch-up she gave me at the end and it was a 5-star experience.BTW it's an Aveda salon in case you are wondering.

924,"I recently moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a good Aveda salon. I googled locations near my office and found Modern Salon. I was able to get an appointment the day of with a junior stylist. I saw Laura and she gave me an amazing hair cut for $36 (excluding tip). I have to admit, I was nervous to see a junior stylist but I can honestly say she gave me one of the best hair cuts I've had in a long time. I definitely recommend her!
",others
925,"I'm hooked. I made a last minute appointment to get all over color and a partial highlight in an attempt to fix a seriously botched coloring.  I showed a picture and explained what I wanted and Laura and Val worked their magic. My hair look amazing and it came out way better than I ever expected.  Also, they did it so that I don't have to touch anything up for 7-8 weeks.  The staff is great and they are very attentive and accomodating.  It can get pricey but it is worth every penny. :)

927,"My first time visiting Palestra. I had an appointment with Sharon. I was looking for a place that specified with skin care. I didn't want to go somewhere and spend a hundred dollars on someone rubbing and massaging products into my face for a hour. I wanted to come out with some results to my skin problems. Sharon did everything I wanted in a facial PLUS more! Their business is skin and it started out with Sharon's mother Hannah and now Sharon is in the business. Its a nice quaint place. Not as grand and opulent as the franchise spas but nice and cozy. Sharon explained a lot of things to me so I could understand what she was doing while she was doing it but not too talkative where I was unable to relax. She started out with explaining her background and than moving onto my skin needs and what she recommends for my facial. She took her time doing everything. SHe was so thorough with her massages and extractions, I LOVED it! What I didn't expect and have never received anywhere else was a foot massage while my face was getting a peel and steam bath! I usually get a hand or shoulder massage but never a foot massage. She massaged each foot and put them into little warm booties. I was in my little own world while she was working on my face. I did not feel rushed I felt like she had all the time in the world to work on my face pore by pore! I loved it and recommend it to anyone who needs skin care!

929,"Finding an esthetician that is good at both facials and full body massages is difficult.  If you want a great experience at a great value, book an appointment with Melanie.  I've had many massages and facials in my life  time and I would have to say she's my favorite!  Very in tuned with the body, mind and soul.  She worked on muscles I didn't know I had, and my face looks so much healthier after seeing her.
",others
930,"Love this place, it is amazing, the prices are pretty good and I only let Melanie touch my face. She is very educated and makes you feel very comfortable. I normalyy get the express mini and I have gone there so many times they know me when I call. I feel very comfortable here. The atmosphere makes you feel very comforable and relaxed and the facials are amazing!
",others
931,"I usually prefer body wraps to massages, but Melanie made me forget wraps even exist! She gave me such a wonderful hot stone massage and was extremely considerate of my preferences throughout - staying warm, making the experience relaxing while still relieving tension, and creating a calm, peaceful environment. She wasn't the least bit pushy and I left feeling more relaxed than I have in years. All around, it's everything I want in a day at the spa and I can't wait to go back!

932,"I heart Modern Salon.An amazing value - got a great haircut and a relaxing (didn't realize that was possible) eyebrow wax here yesterday... only $65!  Lesley gave me the exact haircut I was looking for, all while fixing the goofy layers I was growing out from my last busted haircut.   The service was fantastic... as long as I am in Charlotte, this is the only place I will go.  Tip - they do not let you put tip on the credit card, so make sure you have cash with you!

933,"I really like Modern Salon.  My 1st time going I had made an apt. with Myra for a cut and color.  I didn't know anything about her and I was nervous because my hair is kind of my ""thing.""  And if you get a bad haircut, you have to wait to make it better.Well turns out Myra was great, a really sweet girl and she knows what she is doing.  That first time there I was coloring my hair dark brown and I discussed with her what would I have to do to get back to my natural dirty blonde color when I got sick of being a brunette.  She explained what we would need to do and a little over a year later we started on the process to bring it back to blonde.  It was definitely cheaper to just get cut and color then the highlights and cut, but she does such a good job and I always get a lot of compliments.  And I can let it go for longer in between touch ups.  Also of note, my first time here the receptionist didn't let Myra know I had checked in and so there was a bit of a misunderstanding and I was left to sit for a while.  I approached the desk again after waiting 20 minutes and told them I had a flight to catch in 3 hours, would we be able to start soon, if not I had to leave.Well Myra was so apologetic and she felt awful that they kept me waiting.  I did get out of there a bit later than I would have liked, and I did find myself running to get into the airport, but I did make my flight.  But the best thing was, I got a gift certificate in the mail soon after for either a free massage, pedicure or facial with any other service I had.  I thought that was a really nice touch and I used it for a pedicure after a haircut on another visit.

935,"If you have hair, get your booty to Modern. One of the worst things about moving is having to find a new stylist. Before I moved to Charlotte, I had my stylist do an all-over color to bring me back to my original hair color and wipe out my years of highlights so I didn't have to find someone right away after moving for upkeep. After a year and a half, I finally decided to brave the daunting task of finding a new salon so I could be back to my blonde alter ego. Girls in my office had been recommending Modern for months, but I decided to take my chances elsewhere. Bad choice. After 3 sub-par highlights, I looked like a tiger (in a bad, orange and streaky kind of way) and gave in to their insistence that I try Modern. Man, do I feel silly that I wasted so much time and money at other salons! Sandy, a stylist at Modern, was not only one of the nicest people I've ever met, but she did an outstanding job on my hair. She understood exactly what I relayed to her and went above and beyond in doing a deep conditioning treatment and explaining what we could do next time to make my hair look even better. Sandy is a true professional and really listened to what I was saying about how my hair reacts to different things and they way I like it to look (unlike the other places I had gone, hence the tiger-head.) After a wonderful head massage during the deep conditioning treatment and a fantastic blow-out, i was on my way to face the world looking 100% better than when I walked in. I would recommend Sandy's services to anyone who wants to look fabulous.

936,"I've been getting my haircut here once a month for the past 10 months. I'm very happy. Prior to coming here I went to salon Cielo in the mall and occasionally would go to barbershops depending on what style I was going for. I love the atmosphere in there and the staff is super friendly. Megan is the stylist that I regularly go to. I definitely recommend her for haircuts, she's great. I thought that I'd have a hard time finding a great stylist and a great place to get haircuts, but that's just not the case. A+

937,"I started going to Modern in June when I moved to Charlotte from the DC area.  My family owns an amazing salon in the DC area so I have very high standards when receiving any salon services.  I've also never gone anywhere else for a haircut so I was a little nervous going somewhere new.When I called to make my first appt, the receptionist was very nice.  She asked about  my budget and what I was looking for.  She also explained their different levels of stylists that I had to choose from.The salon is clean, bright, and smells great (thanks to Aveda products)!  My stylist, Siobhan, is so nice and always does an amazing job!  The front desk staff have always been nice as well.

944,"MCV is an Este Lauder salon. Actually it is an Aveda salon (same thing).  I love Aveda! It's like a cult that I am in. Aveda only.There's only 3 beauty products I let touch my skin and hair. Este Lauder moisturizer, MAC studio finish concealer, and Aveda shampoo and conditioner. Get the point I think I should be in charge of the Este Lauder portfolio or a brand ambassador or something. So enough about the Aveda products, the stylists at MCV really do wonders. Since moving to WI, I made myself home at MCV and have a regular hairdresser who makes my life easier and less stressful. Every four weeks for a trim. The convenience and little text message alerts and reminders that MCV send to my phone to remind me of my appointment are helpful. I have a tendency to forget or not write appointments down. Oh and Kirsten does an amazing job. Such talent.  Highly recommend

946,"I'm basically an upbeat positive person...but some days I'm not my normal corky self. I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it. No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco, but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the Sun.

947,"Perry has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years.  Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I askThe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service.

948,"I absolutely love Perry Monge Salon!  I have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed.  The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home.  Marina is amazing with hair...I only wish she could style my hair every morning!  The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix, but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry Monge!

949,"There is no doubting that I am an Aveda girl. Being in Phoenix and having plenty of Aveda salons around you would think I'd be beauty-heaven. But when I left Cleveland I was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so I scheduled my hair appointments around when I'd be flying home. Well, as one could image, that become very expensive, so I finally decided to take a chance with Perry Monage downtown. I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello Can we say amazing!I'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage.

I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try.OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first timeservice but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino. I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell.I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still....It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it.

I am lucky, I work downtown so I am able to make an appt. right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of Saturdays.  Being a client for so long, I have tried their spa, waxing services, and of course hair services, and and happy with everything!  I have even recommended this salon to many friends and family, all of whom are still loyal clients.  An added bonus, my husband and I joined the Aveda Pure Privilege program, it took us approx. 4 years of saving our points, but in 2011, we had a 6 night stay in Jamaica!  It was absolutely wonderful.  We stayed at the Caves in Negril complete with complimentary massages.  Since then we have saved another 44,000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in Antigua next year when we reach 50,000 points.

I have done this annually for her for several years and she had always loved the service.  I must admit that I was going to go to a less expensive place this year...cut backs and the economy.  After reading reviews online, I selected a nail spa close by.  The service was really horrible on the phone.  I can only imagine what it would have been like in person.  I ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to Elizabeth Arden again.  Yes, I spent twice as much for her mother's day present...but I would rather pay double verses deal with poor service and questionable product.  When my mother-in-law comes here she is always happy and feels pampered on her special day.  And they really do gift certificates well.  I will not shop around again!!

Every order I've placed with Snail, small or large (cost, not only size) has been consistently of the utmost quality. As someone who chooses to invest his hard earned money on an item, it gives me relief to know Snail will always provide quality service, care, and most of all, GREAT customer service!To speak briefly about comparison, I've since had experience with other local coating shops.

When he tells you when he will have your items ready, he is right there with it when he promises.  You can find him in his shop way into the late hours...just to get your item completed.  You will never find anyone more Type A about his finished product than Juan.  We have never been disappointed in any item or any quote we have received.

A few months later I brought a set of cheaper wheels (used set of enkei rpf1) and a few suspension parts to get coated and the work was just as phenomenal!

I was pleasantly surprised to receive a link to photos of my wheels after media blasting and at completion.  The work was done on-time and the whole process was very professional.  I couldn't be happier. Now, 2 years later, they look as good as the day I picked them up.You can't go wrong with Snail Motorsports for powdercoating!

984,"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I hate the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes. But of course, a place with the word ""sushi"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy.I at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all I need here. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick. But hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.

986,"I go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me drooling!

For the longest time I could only eat it fresh (not delivery), but this is the second place ever I've found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi appetizer, takosu, flower roll, and a spicy tuna roll with no asparagus. Of the two places ever, this is my new number one. The spicy tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites! The hubby got yellowtail fish jowl, and fried rice... Also very good. Delivery was on point and even the call to put in the order was smooth and easy.

989,"I have long wanted to eat Teppanyaki style food and been thinking of going to Benihana for a longest time. But after reading reviews on Yelp for the one in Sunnyvale, CA, I was quite apprehensive.I had also heard good things about Benihana in Pittsburgh from my brother in law and so decided to go there whenever I goto Pittsburgh.So, finally, we went there after New Years and had a blast. We had to wait at the bar even after making reservation, but thats OK. At the table we were not rushed at all. The food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting. Not to mention very entertaining and friendly bartender  - MARTY.Overall, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.

992,"I swore that Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in Orlando was the best one I had ever been to, but I think they may have some competition with this one.My boyfriend and I tried them out on Labor Day, just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legsfeet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.The food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.

997,"Had a wonderful experience at Benihana with the family last night.  We love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few ""laps"" of the restaurant, without us asking, the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.  Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.  We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better Benihaha was.

998,"I've been coming here regularly for almost 30 years, basically since I was born, starting back when it was Samurai. Some of the older waitresses (Hide!) are like family at this point, so I may be a bit bias. The food is always good, the servers are friendly, and the chefs are entertaining without being obnoxious like a lot of other hibachi places. I'm not big on sushi, but what I've had is good. They have a fantastic selection of wines, beers, and sake. I'll probably be coming here for another 30 years.

999,"I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the 1 place to get sushirolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the timeday you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of SushiSashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the ""Chef's Special"" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.And, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.

1001,"Andy's sushi bar is a convenient little stand set up inside Wholly's in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. It's not a dine in type of place, but it is the best sushi I've ever had. Wholly's sells fresh fish and other meats, so a very convenient place for a sushi bar. My personal favorite of Andy's is the Philadelphia roll - without hot sauce! I used to work in the strip and would often walk down to Wholly's just to get sushi and talk to Andy.

FREE SAMPLES while you wait in line.andy is the best -- hands-down.

1003,"Oh Andy, how I miss your little swagger and sass! I know this is a difficult one to rate, since he runs a stand within another establishment (Wholeys) but I am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar personality. I have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out of Andy.When I worked in the Strip, I ate here almost daily. After only two visits, he remembered exactly what I ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy yellowtail with avocado. Or just yellowtail with avocado. Maybe some cucumber. Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn fine YT)! Sometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait. He once came up with a maki roll made of salmon, basil, cucumber and mango....brilliant!!Wholeys is such a fantastic people watching spot anyway and it's always amusing to see random people of all agesgenderssizes walk in and yell ""ANDY""!

1006,"As much as a sushi fan as I am I going to stick my neck out and say this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Here is my reasoning.Andy is not just a funny guy, but is very generous.  Go when it's not busy and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces.  Talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting with fresh fish.  Next the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh.Finally, the price, load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.  Try Andy's roll and the Eel sashimi.Go see Andy for some great sushi and sashimi.

1009,"To tell the truth, I have never had sushi here, but the Korean BBQ buffet (upstairs) is wonderful!  Lots of different meats and vegetables that you bring to your table and cook there.  The pork is great, there is beef, shrimp, fish, scallops, maybe  I forget it all, but there is a large variety.  And the experience is really fun if you have never tried it before.  At first we were a little worried that we might not cook the meat enough since they pretty much turn the stove at your table on and leave you to your own devices, with little guidance, but we haven't had any problems.  It is not very hard to do.  I love going here and eating a ton of delicious Korean BBQ!  For $19 a person, it is a great deal!

The hae mul pah jun is yummy, the dol sol bibimbap is good, but the soon du bu jige is the best.  It's run by Koreans, hello!  We were lucky to have this place in Pittsburgh - it's not like there was a lot to choose from.

1020,"Little Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced sushi, so it will always have a spot in my heart.  However, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best.  For one, I have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio, and they are one of my favorites.  Little Tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent.  My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.I would highly recommend Little Tokyo, especially over Sushi Two (or Three, I never can remember) on Beverly Road.
",others
1021,"This is by far the best Sushi in Pittsburgh.    The food is all amazing, very fresh and authentic,  and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo.  Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself.  What you wont find here:  A trendy atmosphere like Nakama ( I picked Nakama because it is also so popular in PGH), but the sushi MORE than makes up for it.

1022,"Hurray Little Tokyo!  I haven't been here in years, but this is THE place that I got introduced to sushi.  I still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful thing in the world... and well, kinda loving it.  The owners are good friends of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms.  One time, I had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat.  I know for a fact they use the freshest fish. I may be biased, but I think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob I am today.  Oh yeah, and they have FRIED ICE CREAM.

Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.I should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!

On our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. Eat it slowly.  SAVOR it!  I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona. Also, their desserts are exquisite.  The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed.  I don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good that I order something every time.  P.S. Don't wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table!

I can't imagine going here and not getting that unbelivable sampler.  my mouth is watering as i type.

1031,"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.The staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.Beggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.Next the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. For my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.My dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. I didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh.

1032,"Went to this place with my friends. Everything we had was amazing. The appetizers were delicious. This is what I ordered:1. Miso Soup: Was awesome!!!! very flavorful. My only complaint is there wasn't enough Wakame for my likening. But over all, it was AWESOME!! 1. Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect. 2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside. It was to die for!!! 3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not a great choice to begin with, this was okay, nothing to rave about. 4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside. It was delicious!!! 5. My friend had the assorted Sashimi. The serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff. The white tuna was delicious as was the salmon.

1033,"Great sushi for serious sushi eaters.  The omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go. Quite the adventure.  The sauces the chef puts on the sushisashimi is what makes the difference.The black cod dish is unbelievable.
",others
1034,"Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. The first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.The second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!A final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night.

1035,"Best sushi in Pittsburgh that I've found so far.  So what qualifies me as knowing good sushi  First off I'm Japanese American =)  Not saying that other ethnic backgrounds don't know what good sushi is.  By the reviews I can tell that they do.  But keep in mind I have been eating sushi my WHOLE LIFE!  The price of food is a little higher than one might expect  so if you're a casual sushi eater, you might think twice before coming here.  The restaurant setting feels pretty authentic.  Be sure to make reservations.

1036,"A nice quiet atmosphere with good service and excellent food. I've tried many sushi places in Pittsburgh, and flavorpresentation wise, this was clearly the winner.

1037,"My favorite restaurant in town.Here is the deal with Umi - if you are a casual sushi eater and just a fan of your basic rolls and stuff, don't bother going here. Umi is expensive, rolls will seem small - same as the sashimi and nigiri.However, it is so darn delicious I can't even describe it.  If I could, i would go to Umi every night.  It's simply that good.  It's well, well worth every cent you will spend.Also, try the rock shrimp.  Oh man.I think I am gonna go make a reservation right now.

1038,"This is the real deal...in Pittsburgh. Don't expect flop down for a casual California roll here. They take the sushi and the experience very seriously. The downside is that it you'll never be satisfied with average sushi again.Pro tip: make reservations days in advance.

1040,"I'm very particular about Asian food. Let me emphasize very one more time. Very.I usually have poor experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised with Tai Pei. Both times I dined there, I was greeted, which seems to be a lost art these days, and seated immediately. My waiter was just around the corner and greeted me with water. Both times I ordered sushi, I was able to see it being prepared, which is always a plus. My waiter was quick and served me as soon as the sushi was ready. The second time I went, I ordered sushi and an entree. The service was good but took a while for my main dish to be served. I only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packed.Still, the food was wonderfully prepared. I consider Tai Pei one of my favorite spots!

1052,"While staying in Uptown Charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner. Based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced, well reviewed, ready walking distance option from our hotel.  This one is rated with two $$.  Truthfully some of the best sushi I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.  I'm only on town for the weekend, so I have no idea if they run specials throughout the week.  I will absolutely come back next time I'm here, and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)

1053,"I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini, which was yummy. I'll definitely go back when I travel to Charlotte.

1054,"You know what's crazy I've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time I've actually checked in. I gotta step my game up. Anyhow... Godzilla Sushi Roll is the truth! You can't go wrong, ordering that. I'm seriously stuffed after eating. I mean, the crunchy tempura outside, the savory sauce, the fresh avocado... The ingredients make love in my mouth. Seriously. In my opinion, there's no need to try anything else.Service is spot on. Every time I'm there, everyone is very attentive, and you can't beat the area. I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile. Even if I have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday. It's worth it! I go hard for some sushi, especially the Godzilla roll. Get on it!

Views of many buildings, but set back from the street, just a really great location for evening.Sushi: they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that I've never seen any where else. Really yummy sushi of all types.Drinks: really good mixed drinks and sake! Limited wine and beer.Service: Truly excellent!

1057,"I have had a lot of good sushi in Charlotte, but the Godzilla roll at Fujo just completely blew me away.  It is the best sushi I have ever had.  Delicious just doesn't fully describe it.  When the menu says ""Must try"" they aren't kidding.  It is spicy tuna and avocado fried tempura style and topped with special sauce.  The sauce was superb.  The roll is large, so it is a good one to share, but you won't want to because you will want to eat it all yourself.

1058,"Have you ever left a place and thought: What took me so long to get here That happened to me at Fujo's. My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi! We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  And there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.But let's get to what everyone wants to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my ""go to"" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a ""must try"" on the menu. It's packed with spicy tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. My goodness. How could you go wrong with that combination  Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely worth a try!

1061,"The Sushi ReviewCuisine MalayaPacific Rim ShotOne of the best features of this establishment is its choice location. It's not so out-of-the-way that you have to travel to nightlife and not so on-the-scene that it would attract curious passers-by. I first visited this place to sample the Indian fare which had a good spin on the campus at CPCC. Of course I was drawn to the cliche 1950's pacific-rim archaeologist motif (fan-tan, folding fans, bamboo, etc.) but it was just slightly interesting as compared to the sushi menu, which was surprisingly diverse. The Maki rolls were above average and the Soundboy roll (spicy tuna or smoked salmon Philly tempura) was very good. They have a good selection of Japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm sake on the menu, so there is no immediate reason to order the fancy-pants selections, unless you are trying to impress someone - but that can easily backfire like a '79 Dodge Aspen going up a hill. Stick to what you know, or at least what you have learned so far. The Maki is solid and the Nagiri is good as well. The price is a little above average but you get a decent portion of good sushi. Try the Asahi bottled beer with the warm house sake. If you bring a date you can easily share. The Indian pancake is great for a shared appetizer. The Indian side of the menu is pretty good as well, so give it a shot on your following visit.I recommend Malaya overall for the sushi, location and atmosphere. Afterward, you can take the short drive Uptown and check out the scene.
",others
1062,"Each time I've eaten here, I've been pleased with the food.  The Beef Rendang is wonderful--the lemon grass flavor is prominent and the pepper is just right--not overpowering.  You'll want to start off with the Roti Canai appetizer, which is great--just don't dribble the curry sauce on your tie, 'cause it ain't coming out.  The peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun, too.  The Mango Chicken is aromatic and tasty, but I prefer their Rendang to anything else.  I think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well.  I'm looking forward to trying other items here.  If you're not sure about this place, try it.  I think you'll like it.

1063,"One of the BEST Asian restaurants in Charlotte hands down. I was shocked it was not already on Yelp.They specialize in Malasian Food, but offer a fusion of Japanese (sushi & hibachi), Chinese, and Thai inspired dishes. Honestly I have not tried the Hibachi, but the sushi is among the best, even over sushi specific restaurants!Don't be scared of the term ""Malasian"", if you are not familiar with it. There is not a single person I have ever taken there that has not loved it, and become a regular patron. Even the ""standard"" Chinese Restaurant dishes are really good- Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp, Chow Fun, and fried rice. Try the Roti Telur for an appetizer. It's a savory Curry Broth with potatoes (don't think of Indian Curry), it's mild and I think it tastes similar to Thai Massaman curry. Comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping. Also the Beef Satay is very good.The wait staff is usually very helpful to new customers that are not familiar with the dishes.They do a great Lunch Menu and are very fast with service.Located next to CPCC campus downtown, this place is a must try!

1064,"Great place for authentic south east Asian cuisine. Malay, Indo, Chinese. I have been here once before and really enjoyed the food. Having spent time in Indonesia it is hard to find true authentic food from there. This is the only place in Charlotte for the real deal. If Ian is in, ask for him to help you make your food selection. There is much that isn't on the menu. Ian is the bartender an server. He is Malay and speaks excellent English and has an amazing amount of knowledge about the culture and food influences throughout the SE Asian peninsula. Ian hooked us up last night with some outstanding Malay dishes. We had sea bass that was lightly battered with a mouth watering curry with eggplant, green beans, okra, and onions. The spices in this dish blended perfectly well and I began to understand some of the differences between Indonesian and Malay cuisine that Ian had tried to explain. We also had the beef rendang, that was tender and fragrant. This is slow cooked beef in coconut milk and spices. We topped off our meal with a Asian style flat pancake folded over some ground  peanuts and palm sugar that was grilled in a pan to blend the flavors and served with vanilla ice cream.  The only thing that could have enhanced this dish might be a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Yum!We look forward to returning and having Ian take care of us again.

1066,"Loved, loved, loved Cuisine Malaya. In fact, I immediately wanted to rush home and lose my Yelp virginity after eating here! When you first walk in, it looks like your run of the mill Asian style restaurant. Don't let that fool you. There is magic in the food and service! Orchids hang in boxes on the wall, there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art, and pop music plays on the speakers.  Once seated, we were almost immediately welcomed by our server Ian. Ladies and gentlemen, if you can request Ian upon arriving, DO IT! He is Malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to Malay cuisine. This gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try. He also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes. After the sample, we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever. My friend and I decided to go with the beef rendang (which is so good it will make you scream BOOYAH!) and  the basil duck. The basil duck was off the menu. It came with stir-fry style veggies and the duck on the side. Warning! This dish may make you moan like Homer Simpson. The duck is that good. We also tried a few imported beers, thanks to our oh-so-helpful Ian. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for different flavors. I had a really great experience and look forward to more!
",others
1067,"Cuisine Malaya is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It is also a really good place to go with large groups because they have plenty of space, there is never a wait, and they can accommodate very large groups at one table. Also, the last 2 birthday celebrations we had there with large friend groups, we called in advance to make the reservation and let them know it was a birthday party, and they put up decorations in our area that we were seated at! That was definitely exemplary service.  They also let us bring our own birthday cake and kept it in the fridge in the back and then cut and served it for us after blowing out the candles.  Now on to the food.  The food is always so good.  They are also very large portions, so definitely can share one dish between 2 people.  The roti tellur appetizer is amazing and a must to order if you have never had it.  I also really like the kung pao tofu - the tofu has the perfect texture and crispness.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - everything I have had has been great!

1068,"YUMMM...This place has delicious food and good service.  My favs are the Curry Lakhsa, Mee Goreng, and Tom Yum soup.  It's gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious.  I literally eat here once a week now and if I don't they get worried about me.  The other great thing is that if you want to change up your order (like add more veggies to the sesame tofu, also delicious) no problem!

They came and figured out where to be and when to entertain.""Belle"" came looking just as we expected and nothing less.  She looked good enough to be in Disney LandWorld live-action plays.  She talkedwalkedlooked like Belle.  Glitter Tattoo artist also came with her own chair and table and got her self set up in a convenient place and under the shade.Only thing was that the glitter tattoo artist came on time but forgot her glitter glue so she had to leave and come back.  She stayed past the original time to make up for the delay.  Regardless though, all the kids loved her and all the tattoos were done great.I would definitely encourage everyone to give this place a try.

I usually have my 3 year old with me who sits on my lap, and they talk with her and make her smile.  I am finally getting to writing a review because of a wonderful experience I had today.  I decided to take my two girls in for Valentine's day nail painting as a special treat.  My oldest went first and I was watching with my other daughter on my lap.  My youngest accidentally bumped a bottle of nail polish off the table which proceeded to smash all over the floor.  I was mortified.  They immediately began telling me ""don't worry, don't worry!"" And my daughter was looking pretty sad because she knew she messed up.  They were coming up to her and saying ""don't be sad, it's ok!""  Afterward when they wanted to charge me next to nothing for doing the girls' nails, I wanted to leave a large tip as an apology and a thank you.  They wouldn't let me!  So of course I did anyway and just told the gals to split it.  I still feel terrible about the mess but am amazed at how nice they were about it.

Why I thought I'd be able to do them beautifully when I hadn't done nails since cosmo school, is beyond me, but I was up for the challenge, I guess Well, it turned out (you guessed it) to be a complete disaster. I did them Wednesday night and Thursday morning wanted them off. I was pressed for time because of work and bc of leaving for San Diego today (Friday).The owner and his wife were more than accommodating. He pushed back his gym session Thursday evening bc he knew this was a 'nail emergency' and his wife took over to do the nail art design.

I posted a picture (mine is the blue, gold glitter, and peacock feather).They were all very friendly and welcoming and you can tell they really enjoy doing nails-it shows in their work and what perfectionists they are.I asked how long they'd been there and he said since 2000 which was really surprising to me because the place is so clean it looks like they just opened.So, as a nail salon it really doesn't get much better than this. They've won me over which really doesn't happen often since they're pretty much on every corner.Had to spread the word.Kelsey

1112,"I've been going to this Spa for several years now.  The ambiance is great.  While waiting for my spa treatment, I relax in their quiet room and enjoy a glass of wine and some snacks. The owner, Maryann, gives excellent facials and does amazing permanent makeup.  I had my eyebrows and eyeliner done.  It looks so natural.  She knows what she's doing!  I get my massages here too and even bikini waxes.  If you want a great haircut and color, see Brandon or Kim.  It's awesome to be able to come to one place for all these services and know that you'll be taken care of.  I would recommend this spa to anyone.

And Maryann's vascular treatment for facial blemishes is nothing short of amazing. (There's a bit of a healing process to plan for, but the results are remarkable!) The support staff is warm and friendly, the spa area is cozy and relaxing, and mimosas are served as you prepare to  let your cares melt away. The spa is a challenge to find the first time, but well worth the effort to keep looking. Next time I'll be back for a couple's spa day. Can't wait!

What a find!I'm a last minute lucy, I called for a full head of highlights, base and cut appointment for the next day and they were extremely accommodating, getting me right in and setting me up with Leslie. She was fantastic, very nice, welcoming and a wizard with foil (and there was a lot of foil!) It had been a LONG time since I had my hair done. When you're that neglectful and asking so much you never really know what end result you're going to get but I was pleasantly surprised. Leslie was very thorough and carefully in transforming me back into the natural blonde I should have been. Looks like I found my new hair magician...

1120,"Three girlfriends and myself had a fabulous spa day here.  We flew into Las Vegas, rented a car and went straight to the spa.  I had arranged all of our appointments with Jackie and we can't praise her enough for the great professional service she gave us.  We each had facials, massages, manis and pedis and in between treatments we relaxed in the nicely appointed lounge area  where we were served mimosas and snacks.  Each of us were so happy with our treatments, the package price was very reasonable and we all left refreshed and ready to start our vacation in Las Vegas. Highly recommend this spa.  Everyone is very friendly and attentive.  We hope to return again and make this our first stop before going any place else.  Thank you Jackie and to all the staff that made the start of our vacation so great.  I rated the price as moderate because compared to what the big casino spas want for just a massage...this is priced so fair for the package we received. Sylvia R.

1121,"If your in need of any permanent makeup this is the place!  I have been to many permanent makeup places over the years and this place exceeds.  Min is the artist and she does outstanding work.She listens to how you want your makeup done, the color the shape and when she finishes it's just as you described it.I had my eyebrows done.  This is not something you want to trust anyone doing, but after I was refered to Min, I thought I'd try it.  I was pleased.
",others
1122,"I had my eyebrows tattooed 5 years ago by Min and she does free follow-up annual touch-ups for up to 5 years. So... I had them touched up at least twice. Scheduling the free follow-ups are about 2 months out so it's not like you can just walk in. However, it's pretty cool that she offers it.I was very happy with my brows and have since gone in for some of the facial with LED light treatment packages to reduce the age spots freckles on my face. The process of ridding some of the larger dark spots include burning them off and then staying OUT OF THE SUN while the skin heals back a lighter more blended tone to the rest of your face. She also gives you a bleaching cream to put on the skin to further ensure lightening of the spots. It worked! My face looks more clear than before the treatments. I'll be returning to try out the 3D eyebrows and will update the review once it's done.
",others
1123,"I have since gone back for my 3D eyebrows and I'm very happy with them. Pricing is affordable and really awesome that I no longer have to pencil in my eyebrows or worry about rubbing my eyebrows off during the day. I've uploaded a picture of my 3D eyebrows after having them done about a year ago and since having 2 touch ups. I go back about once every 3 to 4 months. Recently I paid for 5 dermabrasion facials and 16 LED light treatments. Unfortunately my schedule SUCKS ass lately and I can't seem to find time to actually go back and DO the facials. Waaaah.

1125,"Min has been doing permanent makeup for something around 30+ years! I got my eyebrows done by her about a year ago.Pros:- Min is very experienced  - Permanent makeup comes with 5 free appointments for touch ups - Competitive prices- Rooms are clean - Variety of services offered- Friendly and helpful staffConsultbefore the tattooing: An assistant draws in the shape you want with an eyeliner pencil. I did have some doubt right before I got my brows done. My natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape, length, etc, and it's always been difficult to draw them on evenly. But, the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape I wanted them. Getting them tattooed: Min, having been doing this for so long, is confident in what she does, so she does move a little fast. But be assured, she knows exactly what she's doing. I told her I was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry, she would fix it, and she picked a color that would look good on me. Obviously when you're about to have something tattooed onto your face, you want to be 100% sure about everything before you start. I had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark, but I couldn't be more happy with the results. My brows look very natural and people are surprised when I tell them they're tattooed because of how subtle and natural they are. OVERALL: Would recommend! Experienced and friendly. Great prices. I'm very happy with my permanent eyebrows!

1130,"I am a bit psycho when it comes to my locks. I have never gone to the same stylist more than 2 or 3 times because they could never get it right. I bet I have tried 100 salons in Vegas over the years and was never satisfied. They could either color well, but cut disastrously, or cut great but couldn't style right, etc.  Your stylist has a huge impact on your appearance, ya knowAfter extensive research on finding an awesome colorist, Kim at Montage was recommended. After my first visit, I was completely transformed. I swear I looked like a different person! The attention, care and great price cannot be matched anywhere in this town.  I believe a cutcolor from Kim is reasonably priced given the competition (she smokes them!) and the quality of service she provides. Kim has been my stylist for eight years now and I can't even imagine going to anyone else - it would totally feel like cheating. I have never had a bad haircut or color. So many people have asked me about my hair and several friends and coworkers are now loyal to her as well.Oh and the new Montage is just beautiful, very impressive, with a Merle Norman studio attached to it!

1132,"This is a review I wrote for Tammy back in December 2011 (nothing has changed, my hair still looks and feels amazing):Tammy Lord is maybe the 1 most amazing hairdresser ever and I am hating myself as I write this review since everyone is going to want to go to her after (and I will never get in to see her) but still, she needs to props she deserves!!! I don't really know how she hasn't been reviewed yet by anyone else but I guess I will be the first. Tammy has taken my hair from major BLEH to people think my hair looks amazing 6 months+ after its been done by Tammy. Perfect color, perfect cuts EVERY TIME. I guess what spurned this review after so long(I've been her client for a few years) is that I just had my hair done here in San Diego by someone else and I almost cried when he took the towel off my head. The color was NOT right. He used the bleach for the highlights but totally effed up my low-lights (Tammy, if you are reading this, I'm coming in in January...I need you). They do not match my hair AT ALL. My sister and mom go to Tammy as well. They came down to see me for Thanksgiving last week, took one look at my hair and said...why is it orange You need to go see Tammy ASAP. To top it off, he cut these randoms bits of my hair different odd lengths ""to make it healthy"" so my hair looks all choppy and short in some places and long in others. It's just awful. And if you've seen my profile pic, you'll see my hair and see how beautiful it is thanks only to Tammy (pic was taken in February, 2 months after she did it). So it's true folks. Tammy is a miracle worker. She's fixed my hair before when its been botched by these people here in SD and I'm sure this won't be the last time she'll have to do it. She's also incredibly smart, interesting, funny and will always make you feel better about yourself after sitting in her chair for a few hours. It's like a therapy session + hair therapy session...what could be better And don't even let me forget her head massages...OMG. I gotta stop here because now, Tammy is going to be busier than ever. Love love love you Tammy!UPDATE (1112012): I still go to Tammy even though I don't live in Las Vegas anymore. I have 100% complete faith in her and will never go see anyone else.

We purchased our Groupon's and called to book an appointment for almond acrylic sets. We found pictures of what we wanted and showed our nail technicians, Susan and Holly. They were very polite, patient and made sure we had a mutual understanding of what us the clients were wanting. Throughout the manicures they were very thorough and held conversations with us. I enjoyed conversating with my technician, Holly, she was fun and very energetic while she gave me my manicure. Once she finished shaping my nails and lead me to the washing station I glanced at my nails and my mouth dropped. I have NEVER hady nails look so perfect in my entire life. Each nails was perfectly even, smooth, and the exact shape I wanted (mind you this was before they were polished and designed). Soon after my friend Devon texted me saying ""OMG I'm in love""! Once Holly began polishing she coated each nail multiple times and very evenly. I had asked for glitter on my index finger, thinking it was extra, to my surprise it was not! I am just in shock at how gorgeous my nails look and Holly will be my new nail technician for as along as I live in Arizona. Thank you again Holly and Susan, and I will be returning soon.

She used a numbing cream to help reduce the pain. After she finished, she went over after care.

1157,"I first got permanent brows about 6 or 7 years ago. I was fortunate that the lady I picked to do them for me in Tempe was pretty good. The shape was something I could live with but the color turned reddish brown, not good for my skin tone. I had her touch them up a year later and again, I could live with the result because no brow is going to be knockout amazing, right In a couple of years I got lip and eyeliner done. The lip liner I am totally happy with, the eyeliner was spotty and a bit uneven in places, but eyeliner rocks! Last year I found Denise when she ran a special on eyeliner. She redid mine, evened out the rough spots and recommended that I go darker than what I asked for. She was right and it looks wonderful. I finally decided recently that my brows had faded way too much to be ok, I was forced to fill in with pencil each day, which to me is why I got permanent brows in the first place, so that makeup application wasn't necessary every day, right So I called Denise who happened to be running another special, and set up an appointment to do my brows last Thursday at noon. She had me draw the shape plus bring the pencil so she could be sure to match the shade. When I got home I couldn't stop staring at them in the mirror. The lines were so nice, they looked awesome. Plus all the red tone was gone, none peeking through. Today is Tuesday. I took good care to maintain a light layer of Vaseline and didn't rub. This evening they are done, fully shed and beautiful. I couldn't be happier. They are amazing, the color is perfect and they look so good I won't need to fill with pencil.When I'm ready, I will go back for an eyeliner refresher. Denise gets my business. Thank you, Denise!

1169,"I originally called Julianne yesterday (thurs aug 1) to schedule an appointment, and I saw her today at noon. She is located at the district, in green valley. She is room number 9 **inside** of Sola salon behind the cheesecake factory.As soon as I walked into the lobby, she was drawn to me. She was warm, friendly and introduced herself. We went into her personal room, which is glass (she has privacy drapes). She sat me down in a very comfortable recliner, and told me a little about herself before we started to discuss my mistake.....I mean, tattoo.Julianne is certified in micro-pigmentation, which means she knows a lot about skin. She is a member of the SPCP (http:www.spcp.orgthinking-of-getting-a-cosmetic-tattoofind-a-technician).She does tattoo removal with natural saline. The saline removal process is a non-laser ink extraction  alternative, very similar to the regular tattoo process in that it uses similar equipment and procedures.  But instead of pushing ink into the skin, the saline removal system uses a special solution - mostly of sea salt -to create an osmotic condition. As the cells lift due to osmosis, they push the ink  into the scab and out of the skin. Saline tattoo removal generally requires 50% to 75% fewer treatments than laser tattoo removal, and unlike laser removal -- which relies on wavelengths to target  only specific colors -- saline tattoo removal method is effective on all colors of ink and on all areas of the body. (http:dragonflyink.comtattoo-removal)I have been nervous with laser, seeing as how it actually burns skin.She told me that she would work on a few 2 inch sections at a time, so that my body could heal properly and deal with the scabs correctly...about 5 weeks. She would also numb the area as well. Normally, she only does small tattoos (my tattoo is 30 square inches), but she told me she is willing to work with me, and that if I am willing to commit, so is she. At $100 an hour, my husband and I feel that this is a better way then $400 a session laser that will take 7-12 sessions.I can not wait to schedule with her in these next few weeks!She is a true gem personality wise, and I can't wait to work with her. She seems to really care about who she does procedures on, and what she does. I read the filtered review on this place, and it seems very positive.I will do updates!

1170,"Alright, the day has finally came, the day for removal to begin.Julianne is nothing but PROFESSIONAL, I was so impressed by our last visit.The removal starts with her taking a sterile needle, (which she opens in front of me) and scratching it over the tattoo, to allow the pain medicine to seep in.Then, the fun part starts. She takes her tattoo gun, and dips it into a solution of saline. With the pain medicine, I was very comfortable...of course, there were some tender spots (it's just like getting the tattoo all over again.) We are doing two small sections, with two different solutions to see which one works better with my skin, and how I heal with them. We will of course use the one that is most effective. Unlike laser, it is not a ""one size"" fits all approach! She sends me off with a care package, and very detailed instructions on how to treat the wound for proper healing. We have had communication, making sure that I am doing well... I don't even get that from my doctor!Today, is the second day with the wound, and it is sensitive to touch, and some clothing.. like my bra because of it's location. I am excited to see how I heal in the next few weeks!

1171,"Yet another day with Mrs. Julianne....This day was filled with ""once again"" (s), and some new items.((Something New!)) Please note, that she is no longer located in room 9.She has MOVED to room 15.[Sola Salons, The district GVR]The room is larger, and decorated lovely. There is a pin up feel to this room....risque pictures included ! ;)My first session a few months ago was a ""test"" strip, testing two different solutions to see which one worked more effectively with my skin type and the mistake.................I mean, tattoo. **Once again**I am warmly greeted by Julianne. She had ran out to get an ultra soft blanket for my support (and was still on time!)**Once again**Before pulling out utensils, Julianne examines the previously treated spot, addresses my questionsconcerns. **Once again**It is all about ME. My comfort and what would help make our session more productive. Our first session had me on my side, and this time I was on my stomach. Julianne also gets me in the ""mood"" with music.....music that I actually like. No elevator or country music here ! (by my choice, I'm sure if you wanted country, or classical, she would pull up Pandora for you....Which she offered to do for me).How can I not get in the mood of tattoo removal when JayZ and Drake is on!! LOL.((Something new!)) She now has a comfort fishy! Luckily, I used her pinky fishy to have more support for my neckhead, and fishy didn't have to soak up any of my tears. ((something new!)) The recliner is gone. In its' place is a new chair, that reminds me of one at the dentist's office. In a faboosh SNAKE print, of course! **Once again**clean, and sterile tools are open in front of me, with Julianne putting on a fresh pair of gloves. The products she used on me were fresh, she mixed them in front of me...They haven't been sitting around for hours, or days.The anticipation is almost worse than the actual pain. We start with a numbing process, and get to work. Julianne takes my mind off the pain by having great conversation. I don't think there was a thing that we DIDN'T talk about today...haha. Which is awesome. Who wants to sit in silence when you're getting needles dug into you, and salt solution pumped inside you That would be awkward and painful!My pictures are posted. The letters (that have a pinkpurple circle around them) are almost invisible. This is their second treatment. The center looks like a big mass of sunscreen, but that is a salt solution that we decided to leave on. I would rather have a warm, friendly, consistent, thoughtful, professional, quirky longer removal process than to have a quick solution and be treated like some cash cow number. And I'd rather not have my super fair skin burned up by a laser. Well, now that I've confessed my strange love for Julianne.....More updates, and pictures to come!THANKS AGAIN JULIANNE!!!!*****1062014********It has been brought to my attention that Mrs. Julianne has bought a laser and will have it up and running in December ! Saline and laser tattoo removal will be offered! Exciting !

1173,"I went to see Julianne about five months ago to have permanent eyeliner put on. I have tremors and I am no longer able to apply eyeliner. She is the most wonderful,Professional and kind understanding lady I have ever met. She made me feel like a queen for the day. She did such a fantastic job. I have never been so pleased about having anything done with my eyes. It is such a relief not having to worry about putting on eyeliner when my head is shaking so bad. And Julianne really understood that. I would recommend her for any tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, tattoo eyebrows, and so much more of the things that she is able to do. We played around with make up application and she made me look so wonderful. I would give anything to be as skilled as she is. So if you're going to have anything done, tattoo eyeliner, tattooed eyebrows, make up application, tattoo removal, and so many other services she is the place to go. So if you want to feel beautiful and that you really matter then go see Julianne. Instead of five stars I give her 10. Thank you Julianne for making my eyes look so great. Love you

So it is so wonderful to have permanent eyeliner. I would recommend her to anyone who has special needs with the services that she provides. Such as tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, and permanent eyebrows. And so many more services. She is now doing permanent hair removal. So I am so excited to begin that service. She makes you feel like you really count. She is the most meticulous person I have ever been to. I would recommend her 100% to anyone who needs services done that she provides.Thank you Julianne for always making me feel special.

I freaking loved my hair.  LOVED.MY.HAIR.  Bangs! Bangs!  And not the kind that you thought would make you look like Zooey Deschanel but instead you look like you are 10 and your mom got your hair cut at Fantastic Sams and never, ever, ever lay right!Bangs!  Like long, sweeping bangs that fell right and made all my friends say, ""I wish I could pull of bangs!""I LOVE THIS PLACE.  They moved to Lawrenceville a few years ago, and I havent been to the new salon yet bc its been that long since I've had my haircut which is so sad.  It's like witch craft, what they do with hair, and I need some magic.I highly recommend this salon.

1178,"5 stars just based on the Estee lauder counter. The girls Lisa and Ann are extremely professional with their customers. For example I get courtesy calls reminding me of special limited offers for face cleanser and serums. One time I received a call from Ann that they just received a special shipment of only a handful of gift sets for the holidays and that they could put one on hold for me. Since this stuff is pricey, the associates make sure that your money is well spent. They even help with the fragrances too. Got several men's fragrancees (Polo red, Aqua Di Gio, John Paul Gultier, CK Euphoria, Dolce and Gabana Sport) and complimentary body wash, duffle bags, and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance. So all in all I base the ratings just on the two departments I visit most often. This is not the typical department store that I am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok. I don't go to Boston Store for clothes or shoes. Home decor isn't too bad either. Saw several glass Santas and nativity sets that would look great if only I had more space

I recently moved to DC and have let my hair go for 6 months because I knew I'd be back home in Madison around Christmas and could sneak into Ultimate and get my hair done right.When I first started going to Tiffany, I did what every girl does post-break-up.  I sat in her chair and told her I didn't care what she did with my hair but that I needed something different.  She gave me the perfect cut and color.  I was stopped multiple times by strangers asking me where I had gotten my hair cut.  It was stylish and professional - plus, I could just blow dry it into shape, no need to curl or use a straightening iron.Love this place!

1181,"I LOVE Ultimate! A friend referred me to Alyssa and she is who has done my hair for the past two years! She's great and always makes me hair better than I imagined. The salon is nice. Other reviews say they are pricey but you get what you pay for. I get a paraffin dip and neckscalp massage when I get my hair done. I'm not sitting there all day like other places. The front desk is very friendly and I even get mailed coupons for discounted services. I will be going back as long as I'm living in Madison. :)

1183,"My sister and I decided to give our mom a complete ""makeover"" as a gift. I called multiple salons to inquire if they would be able to strip color out of my mom's hair. (She decided to stop coloring her hair and let her hair grow out, so she had greywhite on top and dark brown a few inches down.)Many of the salons said that it could not be done. When I spoke with someone at the Ultimate Spa Salon, they stated that they would be able to lighten the color so it would blend better with her natural hair color. The stylist was very nice, discussed what she was going to be doing.  She put lightener on my mom's hair a few times. I was nervous that it wasn't going to work.  She got a new hairstyle, and when it was all done, she looked FABULOUS!  I was very pleased with how it came out.  It was pricey to have it done, but when it comes to a drastic change, I'd say it's worth it!

1184,"I'm basically an upbeat positive person...but some days I'm not my normal corky self. I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it. No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco, but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the Sun.

1185,"Perry has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years.  Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I askThe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service.

The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix, but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry Monge!

But when I left Cleveland I was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so I scheduled my hair appointments around when I'd be flying home. Well, as one could image, that become very expensive, so I finally decided to take a chance with Perry Monage downtown. I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello Can we say amazing!I'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage.

1190,"I was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the Phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in Colorado. I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try.OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first timeservice but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino. I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell.I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still....It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it.

If you are Latina, have curly hair, and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl, this is your place!  Saturdays are busy, but I try to avoid them.  I am lucky, I work downtown so I am able to make an appt. right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of Saturdays.  Being a client for so long, I have tried their spa, waxing services, and of course hair services, and and happy with everything!  I have even recommended this salon to many friends and family, all of whom are still loyal clients.  An added bonus, my husband and I joined the Aveda Pure Privilege program, it took us approx. 4 years of saving our points, but in 2011, we had a 6 night stay in Jamaica!  It was absolutely wonderful.  We stayed at the Caves in Negril complete with complimentary massages.

1195,"This is the best bike store I've walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.Edit, 4 years later: Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)It's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.  Friends have terrific luck with Pittsburgh Pro, which is nearer,  and I'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, Big Bang is my absolute go-to.

1196,"This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.At Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.Also, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you ""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.

I would like to update to reflect further experiences I've had with BBB.So, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.My husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.I would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.  I haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop, even when bringing in a bike that I haven't bought there.

As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.Yes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high. Cycling is expensive, end of story. If you're looking to pick up your next huffy, go to walmart. If you want a quality bike that is going to fit you, and operate perfectly: go to big bang.

I basically just walked in and said I was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them (I'm a MTBr). I was helped by Glenn, who, within two minutes, had me sitting on a bike, measuring me and adjusting things, and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike. At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new. He was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs. So very impressed...this is absolutely where I will be buying my bike.

I went back the next day to try it out, and though I ended up liking the other (less expensive) model better, I thought it was great that he was willing to assemble a bike just so that I could try it out to be sure of my decision.

1214,"yeah. it's true alright. though it is cramped and messy and the old dude is grumpy, he has a heart of gold and this place is one of the very best. like best on earth. I always seem to go in frustrated and leave happy. this is likely a combination of the fact that I go with a broken bike that leaves fixed and the fact that the cost of fixing is so..reasonable. I recently replaced my brakes and the ones the old guy gave me were missing a screw so he upgraded me to the next nicer ones for free. this guy is really a treasure. and this place is too. I look forward to the next bike repair because this place is so unabashedly wonderful.
",others
1215,"Haven't been in a while (not really a bike nut, or even a regular rider) but I have to relate a story to tell you what kind of a place this is... I inherited a bike my dad had purchased in college, and hard a part break, I knew that Kraynick's would be the only place able to help, even though at the time there were still Schwinn ""authorized"" dealers in the area. Here's the exchange: Me: ""I have an old Schwinn three-speed, probably from 1969 or '70, and it has this little washer with a raised part that fits in the groove between the fork and the rear axle. That part broke."" Him: ""A Collegiate or a Speedster"" Me (amazed): ""Speedster."" At which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling, pull open a single drawer, and produce the part I needed. It cost something like 30 cents... Places like this pretty much do not exist anymore, the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full). If the recurring rumors of its closing  Mr. Kraynick's retirement are any indication, it may not be here forever. FIND ANY EXCUSE to get here while it's still around!

1216,"Kraynick's Bike Shop is a diamond in the rough... even if the diamond itself seems rough. It's messy sometimes and definitely cramped. But if you can deal with that, it is a great resource for Pittsburgh cyclists. There are six racks in the back where patrons can work on their bikes, and Gerry will sell you the necessary parts at discount rates.Many times I've gone in to fix ""just one quick thing"" and then three hours later I finally leave. It can be intimidating if you don't know much about bike mechanics, but other people there are usually helpful and friendly, and though he doesn't always radiate warmth, Gerry has helped me with a number of issues.In short, a great resource and way to learn a lot and save money if you have the time.

1217,"Some drunk asshole fell into my back tire and completely ruined it. Rather then go to Trek and spend a good $100 for a new tire and the labor I headed to Kraynicks.I spent around 3 hours fixing not just my back tire, but my shoes, shifters, and I even cleaned up my chain and gears. I love that you go in to fix a simple issue but end up spending hours there. You can't help it. Gerry and John are great people and their willing to help you because they just love what they do rather than to just make a profit. I already want to go back. And yes best bike shop in existence is a pretty accurate statement.

1218,"Great spot for weird or obscure parts, general maintenance items, and to  borrow a wrench or two.  Gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle.   I remember going there for my first time in the early 90's and it hasn't changed in almost 20 years.

1219,"Kraynick's is a real gem for Pittsburgh.  This isn't the place to take your high-end carbon frame bike, but Jerry will help you get your commuter, beater, or frame you found trashed in a ditch in the woods back on the road.  (Seriously, there was a guy in there salvaging an old MTB frame he found in a ditch in the woods.)  Be forewarned: he's pretty typical of a lot of old school Pittsburghers: very gruff at first, but actually a nice guy when he warms up to you.I haven't had a bike in ten years and decided out of nowhere to build one around an old frame and a new internal gear hub.  I bought a few high-end components online and the rest from Jerry.  Despite bringing in outside parts, Jerry was still gushing with help, and, after several weeks and 3-4 visits, I'm riding a bike that I built from scratch after going in with no mechanical knowledge of bikes at all.  He doesn't carry new super-high-end components, but the stuff he does carry is solid, and he has every weird bracket or screw or cable guide you can imagine from decades of scrounging parts.  He can help you with any weird setup you want.  (Mine's definitely out-of-the-ordinary.)One warning: this is your standard old Pittsburgh small business, so he doesn't take credit cards.  It's a little annoying considering that you might be spending over $100 on parts and service, but there's an ATM down the block.

1220,"While I was a little skeptical walking into the place, I loved the experience in the end.  EVERYTHING you need, or could possibly ever think of needing is there in the shop, in multiples.  If you don't know what you're looking for, or how to fix it, Gerry will help you.  As will the 6 other bike fanatics who are in the shop working on their own bikes.  The prices can't be beat.  And, while you have to do the work yourself, it's really rewarding to walk out of there with a bike you fixed yourself.  Same repairs at REI or Dick's would have been two to three times as much.  Would definitely go back for more!

The merchandising manager, Dean, has styled the store beautifully. I love looking at the styling on the mannequins to get ideas for outfits.The shoes have drastically improved over the years, and I absolutely love the Abby flats. They are extremely comfortable while still being stylish. They get new colors seasonally, which makes me a happy girl!

They asked what we were shopping for, guided us in the right direction, and set up a fitting room for him while we were still browsing. Next time I needwant to shop at Banana, this will definitely be the store that I head to!

I arrived 10 minutes before closing (5:50pm) and was greeted enthusiastically when I walked in.  I told the greeter that I was new to the store and to firearms in general.  After a quick discussion  about what I was looking for, he immediately introduced me to an extraordinarily knowledgeable associate.  By the way, at 5:50pm on a monday, this place was PACKED.  But there seemed to be 30 or more associates working, so there was no waiting.  Since I was new to skeet shooting, my person helped me look at different fits and helped me with some shouldering and sighting techniques.  The prices seem in-line with what you would find anywhere else.  I was not ready to buy that day, but I am confident I will buy there when the time is right!

But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  I agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) You'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  The place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discountssales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty.

I headed to Hyatt because they have everything!The staff is very helpful and were more than patient to point out where stuff was in the large shop and provide expert recommendations. They have a great selection of all of the stuff I wanted, but I think that the prices were quite high. If you are buying something that can ship in the mail (i.e., not a gun or live rounds), then you'll want to get it from eBay or one of the sporting supply shops online. You'll save a ton.

If you don't like to haggle then check out their website for their online deals. That is where you find the usual rock-bottom pricing for the firearms they carry. I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go to Hyatt's. It's located in the hood but don't let that stop you. Once inside you will feel very safe as every employee is carrying heat!

1232,"Alexis below posted about not needing a gun and gave the store a three star rating.   Sorry sweetheart.  YOU DO need a gun and here's why. The day  you need one you may not have one.  Then what I teach firearms and gun safety classes and have had many women lately telling me why they decided to sign up and get a concealed carry permit.  They also didn't think they needed a gun until they were assaulted.   Women are looked on as victims by any perp who wants to control or harm them.  A gun is an equalizer.  You may never use a  gun for self defense but there might come a day when you need one you won't have one.  Consider the woman at Luby's cafeteria and whom on the ONE day she didn't have one, she lost both her parents due to leaving her gun at home.  Consider the lying hypocrite Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head. She maybe would have been able to save herself and others.  Consider the kids at Columbine if only ONE teacher had a gun.  Consider the Washington Navy yard.   Consider Amanda Collins who recently testified in Colorado about being denied the right to carry on campus and ended up being raped.  Don't think for a moment you don't need one because you live in Dilworth.  There are still robberies, assaults, etc that occur there.  And please, don't blame the gun store or its employees for suggesting a common sense thought.  You may come to regret doing so in the future.

1234,"Hyatt Gun Shop should be a lesson to every other business on Earth about customer service.  Every single employee is helpful and friendly.  There's none of the elitist attitude that is typical of many gun stores.  They're knowledgeable but don't make you feel like a moron.  On a practical note, I've purchased two firearms here and in both cases prices were better on their online store.  You're probably best off buying what you want (if you already know what you want) online, then picking it up in store.  My most recent purchase was this way, and I payed about $100 less online than the price tag said when the guy behind the counter handed it to me.  Granted I've only bought two guns here, but I suspect such will be the case more often than not.Ammo prices reflect the free market.  All the ammo I've bought here has been on par with gunbroker.com (I checked on my phone before buying), which I think is the best indicator of market conditions.  People complaining about the prices obviously don't understand supply and demand.  The demand right now is significantly higher than supply.  There are two ways a business can react to that.  1) They can take the approach that Walmart has and restrict how many boxes each customer can purchase per day (which still leads to shortages as we have seen), or 2) They can raise the price which Hyatt and most others have done, reasonably in my opinion.  Yes, prices are high and that sucks, but with this approach it is still available if you are willing to pay.  Notice how Hyatt has plenty of selection, anything you want from what I saw.  It's not Hyatt's fault that the demand is so high right now (you have the government to thank for that).I've never used their gunsmithing services, so I can't speak to them.I'll be taking some classes with them soon, and given the impressive backgrounds of the guys teaching them, I suspect they will be awesome.This is a great, great store and I highly recommend it.

1235,"Hyatt's has two extremely strong reasons why you should shop there: Selection and Service.   They have the best selection of firearms, east of the Mississippi river.   And the level of service is unmatched.   There are several ""experienced"" gunsmiths on duty every day and if you need something fixed, it can usually be done while you wait.  The staff knows firearms and won't BS you.  The prices are higher than online, however they will accept a reasonable offer.   And if you are not happy, they will make it right.

Though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude, they are always willing to help you find what you're looking for. The layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel. These guys have a great selection from different brands. North Face, Arcteryx, Patagonia, Marmot, and some others. I also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear. Their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need. I've never purchased one from these guys, but they have a killer selection of knives, too. In the past couple of years I've purchased plenty of MSR camp stove canisters from these guys. They always have a plethora. Also picked up a nice Thermarest from here. Most recently, my wife and I were looking for a nice mid-layer jacket for the winter for her. We checked out a few different options in the women's section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from Patagonia. It was on crazy sale, too. Don't remember exactly how much we ended up paying, but I know it was close to 60% off from the previous year. If I'm ever looking for something particular, Jessie Brown's always has it or at least something comparable. Love coming to this local shop!

Maybe I was high from winning $50 on bingo earlier that night (HUGE winnings from someone who usually gambles about $1 per Vegas trip, on penny slots no less), but I was really taken with this little gem of a place. It's such a well-hidden secret that I'm guessing the only the locals go here, but once you step inside, you will be transported to the Emerald Isle. The pub is run by an Irish gent, and hey, my waitress was Irish too, so there are some authenticity points. I played a show on this particular evening and the crowd was enthusiastic, polite, and focused on the music. (I guess my expectations were that of playing to a bunch of rowdy footballers (so maybe the pub is not THAT authentic). I sold some cds, met some new fans, and sat back to watch the headlining band Darby O'Gill and the Little People. Things got particularly raunchy when they covered ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". I mean, hey, they also play a song called ""Got So Drunk I Crapped Myself"" and have an album called ""Christmas Songs for drunken Athiests"" , so you kind of know what you're in for. Darby O'Gill is the house band...make sure you get there on a Wednesday night to check them out. What to order: Guiness, a Veggie Burger, and Mashed Potatoes (w a sprig of Rosemary).

1241,"This is my four day review of McMullan's Irish Pub. Just to qualify, I flew from Orlando Florida to Las Vegas just to spend four days in this specific Irish Pub. I may be a bit biased.The pub has three distinct sections. At one end is a bar with video poker machines. These are the multi-denominational multi game machines so you have choices. The bar also has a lot of promotions such as a free spin for prizes for every four of a kind you hit. Smoking is permitted in this room - picture old vegas and you get the picture. The middle section is more like a traditional Irish Pub - no gaming and lots of private seating for meals. Of course the Guinness is a proper poor - no sense reviewing an Irish pub that can't do that. The back is another bar that is mostly for private events and the like. It's got a full bar and plenty of room for a decent get together.The Shepherd's Pie is wonderful as is the Farmhouse Irish Breakfast. (Before you ask - white and black pudding is sausage) The service is great and personable 24 hours a day.We got in at 1:30am Christmas Morning and headed to McMullan's right after checking into the hotel. A night cap of a couple of Guinness while we watched the marathon of A Christmas Story on TV. After catching a few winks we were back again for Christmas breakfast of a few more Guinness and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs - wonderful.We repeated this similar pattern until the 27th when we came back for a private party. The service for our party was fantastic! My wife made all of the arrangements and said that Brian McMullan was wonderful to work with.All in All I'm pretty stingy with my five star reviews. This place is definately worth every star.

1243,"In my humble and somewhat besotted opinion the McMullan family run the single best Irish pub in Las Vegas.  Unlike the vast majority of bars in town, this is not a corporate operation run by MBAs from afar.  Instead, the eponymous McMullans are there every day.  Furthermore, they are extremely involved in the community.  Their ""St. Baldrick's"" charity drive raises donations in six figures for children with cancer every year.  McMullan's Pub features all the beverages that you would expect in an Irish joint with the food being a definite step above usual bar fare. (I'm partial to the fish & chips, myself.)  However, the social experience, good music and the ""craic"" is what you go for here and you get a full heaping serving of it on every visit.

HIGHLY recommend the fish and chips.My only complaint was that the main entrees weren't served at the same time so people gobbled up the fish and chips in 2 seconds and some people had to wait 10 minutes before the next entree came out.  That could have been timed a little better so that everyone could have gotten some of everything instead of it being staggered so much.All in all though, I highly highly highly recommend McMullan's.

There are dozens of meat market dance clubs available in the Uptown area.  However, if you're looking for a place to get drunk and dance to Micheal Jackson hits, or sip a beer and watch replays from 80's dunk competitions, this place is going to thrill you.  Most important, the vibe here is unlike any dance club I've been to.  You're far more likely to see a Sid Vicious look-alike or a break dancing session form in the middle of the floor than you are to see a shoving match or a fight break out.  80's music has a way of draining the aggression from testosterone pumped drunkards.  And that provides for the most enjoyable dancing experience I've had in Charlotte.Everyone looks ridiculous when they dance to 80's music.  So if you're accustomed (like I am) of looking ridiculous when you dance, you'll love The Breakfast Club.

Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way.  Hmm...pre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  I'm a skeptic.  After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!  By the way, my spy happens to be an employee so I know it's true.  All in all, this place is great.

It makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and fun.There's lots of vegetarian options, which is always a good thing. Everything is presented beautifully, which is always fun.

Especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in Chicago might just reach capacity down in Champaign.How I miss it.
",others
1260,"I've never been here for a show...well, let me clarify.I used to come here tons as an undergrad for various Asian parties, and I still come here most times I've visited as an undergrad.  Things usually devolve into a shit show.Which, honestly, is a good thing, and it's what I'm shooting for when I want to forget about the real world for a weekend.  Sure, it's off campus, but it does have a giant dance floorstage and some awesome people behind the bar. Last time I was here I just kept asking for either A) something awesome or B) something alcoholic.  Never was disappointed once.If anyone you know is planning a party at the HD, be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up. You won't regret it (and you might not remember it).

1262,"My and my main yelper came from Indianapolis to watch Corb Lund play at The Highdive.  It's an intimate concert venuebar, and we had a great time.  Parking was a breeze, we found plenty of spaces on a Saturday night right in front of the venue.If you're coming to a show, get there early to snag seating.  We found great seats up in balcony, which had it's own bar.  Were the bar stools and benches comfortable  Hell no.  Not at all, but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns.  Maybe it's because I'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink, but $4.50 Wild Turkey mixers made for a great night!  Service was quick, and I never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was nice.All in all, a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music.
",others
1263,"Folks, this is your quintessential small town concert venue.  Great prices, great service, great music.  I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  What I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.  I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy.  Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.

1264,"This bar is pure vintage.  Chester Street is where my club life began.  I spent the good majority of my nights (between the ages of 19 - 22) at Chester Street.  It is still my all-time favorite club to this day as far as atmosphere, music, and engineering.  The dance floor is massive with a giant mirror in the back.  There are speakers to dance upon (or used to be), which is an added bonus.  The bars are offset from the dance floor, which alleviates any added congestion (like I see too frequently at the STL bars).  It was extremely economical at the time - I think cover was maybe $2 on the hoppin' nights, and you could easily drink yourself stupid for $20-30.  It was a hell of a lot of fun, and I am in the process of actually planning a trip back soon....long over due.  CU is a fun town period.  C Street is a nice little gem snug in the middle of the city where people can be themselves & dance the night away to the best clubhouse beats.
",others
1265,"What is this magical place you call C Street I used to be afraid of this place as a closed-minded junior. ""It's too far, I won't like the crowd"" I told myself (read: I'm a straight male). But I gave it a shot one day and wow. C Street has the best DJ's and dance floor onnear campus. You can truly dance like a dying flounder and it's totally acceptable (at least late enough in the night). From what I hear from my friends who are girls, they really enjoy it because there aren't guys constantly trying to dry hump them into oblivion. If you want to let loose and get a good leg workout, go to C Street with a group of friends and let the music take control.ps. Yeah, there are still the creepers who hang at the bar and there is typically cover on the weekends, but it is still exponentially better than any other dance bar in CU.

There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!

After 2 it turns 18and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. NOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind ofplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot moreeye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.Bathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about thebathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.

1273,"It doesn't matter what anybody says about dance night clubs, you have to see for yourself because this club is absolutely incredible they have an amazing sound system and laser light, this is definitely where I would want to be on the weekend if I'm looking for a dance club. This club is so good it has received the best of Phoenix Award several years in a roll, none of the Latino dance clubs have survived only this club because the owner knows what he's doing and provides great music and entertainment you have to go stop in and see this place if you're looking for a Latino club this is really the only place in Arizona to go.  Also the club has a food taco stand outside which is good and also an amazing outdoor patio that's absolutely beautiful it also has there are areas in the club that are sort of tucked away where you can sit with friends and drink and have a really great time. I am LMAO at all these little young tweakers who are posting bad reviews because they had a bad time give me break they have no clue what a really good dance club is all about, and their one time bad experience has nothing to do with the quality of a club. Maybe if they weren't so high they could have enjoyed the club lol.

Live Music!The entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just don't find anywhere else!Now,  besides the playing there I have no relations with anyone in the place, and all I know is that when I ask the owner if I could use the bar for an event to raise money for my sister, who has been diagnosed with cancer. With out a blink of an he said yes and they have been great help at helping me organize the event.The bar has a huge parking lot and easy access!The Bartender and waitresses or really on their game.

1276,"I have taken several group lessons on Tuesday evenings for West Coast Swing. Instructor Robert Campos is one of the best WCS instructors in the valley. His instruction is clear and he demonstrates great ability at handling large crowds. His classes are very popular so expect large crowds. Getting personal attention can be problematic but fortunately Robert has an assistant to help people. Partners are rotated often so expect to meet lots of other people who love to dance. There is a meat market aspect to these large group classes but I always enjoy the opportunities to meet beautiful ladies. After rotating to dozens of partners it's easy to break the ice to get them onto the dance floor.After most of the group lessons Paragon keeps the floor open for several hours. The music and dancing is always good. I like the dance afterwards to practice what I learned in the group lesson.  Friday night is the best ballroom party in the valley. They start by giving a group lesson in a different ballroom style every week. The lessons are excellent quality. Once the lessons are over the large floor is devoted to ballroom and the smaller one to West Coast Swing. Snacks are served and dances last until midnight. The East Valley is very lucky to have a studio like Paragon. Sometimes I feel I spend more time there than I do at home!

1277,"I came here for the first time and didn't know what to expect. It turned out to be a lot of fun! First, (we went on a Friday) it's $7 cash at the door to get in. At 7:30 the dance lesson began....or was supposed to (it started more around 7:45) The lesson of the night was West Coast swing. Apparently they teach different genres of dance every week, you need to check their website to see what they are offering for that week. They split off the beginners from the intermediateadvance dancers. Us beginners were put in a smaller dance room studio (to my releif, as I have never danced West Coast Swing, and was nervous to be in front of advanced students...)After an hour of class (which goes by very fast!) they have an open dance floor until midnight. Most of the people there are people who simply love dance. They switch up the music to a different genre for every song, i.e. waltz, foxtrot, salsa, rumba, swing...etc. Even if you are not a great dancer, or only know one genre of dance, it's certainly fun to watch everyone! There are some really good pros and amateurs, no one really cares what you look like out there, everyone is just there to dance! (There were people there of many age groups as well....from early 20's to 60's or 70's!)I love that you can just drop in for a class. No sign up or commitment necessary! I'm looking forward to dropping in again soon!

1278,"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's ""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.

If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.-Fish Sandwiich-Salmon (huge and delicious)-Flounder-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)-Hawkins St Special-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious.

1284,"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big BurritoSousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly'This is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.

Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.

The chef actually came out and explained the cheeses on our plate.  Nice touch, though I have to admit to not necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation.  Nonetheless, all were quite tasty and better than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  I ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin, the Novemberfest special, which was also tasty from the bite I acquired from him, as were the squash bites I ""stole"".  Service:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away, despite being very early for our reservations.  Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in need.Ambience:  We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  Cozy, quaint, warm feel to it.  Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversation.Entertainment:  I've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully.  Last night was a winner for jazz band quality and for the vocalist's quality.  Very nice, indeed.

They have so many salad dressing choices not your ordinary blahzay boring choices. The spinach salad was also AMAZING spinach walnuts,feta,cranberries. The Caesar is what you would expect generous portion but average.Then a soup choice of French onion or soup de jour  (soup of the day) my husband had the french onion Wow he said it was prepared perfect and how french onion should be served a nice crock full and nice amount of cheese covering and balance of bread and soup. My mom and I had the soup of the day which was a roasted red pepper mushroom soup this was a soup we had never experienced and boy was it fabbie definitely a soup we shall enjoy again.Now the main course.a 6 oz Filet Mignon and 4-5 oz Lobster tail , Twice baked potato, Fresh white asparagus. The steak was cooked PERFECT my Mom and I ordered med rare my husband ordered his med and there was not an issue with either.If all this wasn't enough choice of homemade desserts  was carrot cake    or brownie a la mode.we all chose the brownie a la mode.

It came with coleslaw as well, but it wasn't anything special. Standard coleslaw mix. Anything that was wrong with the rest of the food I received was immediately forgiven when I started eating the chicken. I also got the cheese sticks which are never a disappointment.

1308,"My wife and I wanted to try Cain's after we got a Yelp email around Halloween that highlighted the best Bloody Mary's in Pittsburgh. We bookmarked the places and figured eventually we'd hit them all. I called on a Wednesday in February one afternoon asking what time they served breakfast on Sunday's. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well done, and the hollandaise was rich and creamy. The bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well. We had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives! The wait staff was super friendly and extremely kind. When we got our bill we were told that Joey had gotten our first round of drinks! Way to go Cain's! You delivered a solid meal, excellent service and a great atmosphere. We'll definitely bring friends here and come back soon!

1309,"I was fortunate enough to find this restaurant for a delicious lunch while traveling in the area.  I went off and performed my seminar then decided to return for a late supper. I sat at the bar and was served by a young woman whom I had assumed was the owner based on her superb professional demeanor. She informed me she was a 'very new' server.  WOW Araci's, hold on to this gem.  As it was late, I decided to create my own supper from various appetizers. One was better than the next, by the way, but I also wanted to point out that this 'very new' server had such a unique way of suggesting additional culinary delights, even this seasoned traveler was hooked, and glad he was! Everything she suggested was perfect.  My only regret is I don't live closer to Pittsburgh so I might be able to return.

1311,"I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too.

1314,"Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 12 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.

1315,"Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!

1316,"Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have ""dippy"" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a ""dippy"" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!

1317,"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. Here are the highlights:-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)-Cash only-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo

Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.Remember it is a diner.

I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.

1328,"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  Not only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.

This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!
",others
1334,"Let's start with the conclusion - this place is the very best breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  Why  In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.First are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!Second, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the ""jumbot"" - an ""everything in the prep table"" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.The food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation ""table syrup"" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!This place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.

1336,"OMG!  Hands down the best pancakes I have ever put in my mouth. Sometimes I day dream about Dor Stop pancakes.  Too bad I live 6 hours away or I'd go there everyday.  The service was just ok, but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait.

1338,"The Dor-Stop restaurant has an enchanting, old fashioned look inside and out that effectively conveys its main appeal: good simple cooking at reasonable prices. The menu has typical diner favorites. I ordered the ham off the bone breakfast (with their special ham, potato pancakes, eggs, and toast) and true to form, it was very good (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7.   I went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full, so I didn't have to wait. Food came quickly and service was good (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as ""honey"" every time).  As I was finishing up, an older gentleman, seemingly a ""regular,"" came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff. He took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him. (He ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup.) And he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch. I'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great place this is and keep coming back.

1339,"I had no idea that this restaurant was ""legendary"" when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease, and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.The restaurant is ""cozy"" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed,* we were seated right away.The menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers, american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.The portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic, which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman. I think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum.

1340,"If you ever need an explanation of what a bottomless cup of coffee truly signifies, check out the Dor-Stop.In addition to that lesson, the you will experience the following:-Hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin, like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake)-Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders-Slabs of ham. So good.Add in the great service, ease to find parking, and decent prices and this place is truly a gem. Don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly, and for 2 people on a Sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited). And it is definitely worth the wait.

1341,"Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.The place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 34 full before it was refilled.Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.I got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.Oh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.

1342,"I called on Memorial Day and said ""I was just checking if you're open today."" ""No,"" she snapped, ""we're closed, ya jest woke me up!"" Well, with customer service like that, I knew this had to be a real diner.And boy oh boy was I right. Hotcakes thick and soft as fresh cookies, something called ""jumbot"" (which seems to be Pittsburghese for ""whatever we scraped off the grill"", but boy is it good), and good luck finding the bottom of a cup of coffee, because they'll never let you get low enough to see it.Maybe these aren't the hugest pancakes in town (that honor goes to the MANcakes at Eggs-R-Us in Crafton), but they sure are delicious. Well worth a few minutes' wait for a table.

The food is great diner breakfastlunch fare at extremely reasonable prices (and by ""extremely reasonable"", I mean that it's freaking cheap). Mama Ros and Mike really just want to feed you. They give food to the homeless, and every Thanksgiving they host a huge donation-based Thanksgiving dinner for all those who can't afford throwing a feast themselves or who can't be with their families during the holiday (or who would rather avoid being with their families in favor of the awesome Thanksgiving party that is Mama Ros's turkey dinner).Great food, a business that's truly for the community, and a home away from home experience.

""Mom"" is a typical short order chef with years of experience under her belt. The food was hot, fresh and simple and the coffee was surprisingly good. Even though it is clearly a locals place (four people came and went whose food came without ordering it), the owner couple were welcoming and chatty. I heard all about their thanksgiving. They were closed Thursday and Friday to serve or deliver 300 meals to the needy in their community. 130 deliveries and others picked up.

1354,"Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head......having wine and cheese.......or breakfasting.The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.That's probably sufficient gushing.

1355,"Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back).

They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.

I bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is. I'd return in a heartbeat.

The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!Service is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee andor tea!All the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  They also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!

1362,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet. It was a room off by itself which I was unaware of at the time of booking. That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry. The service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. I hope to visit again some day.

1368,"Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the ""hood"" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  ---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!
",others
1369,"Strange...the reviews seem to be all over the place  for this the best seafood joint in town.  I think their 60 year operation speaks for itself.  I've been a semi-regular for years now and love their fish.  It's the best breading I've ever tried.  Almost as important as the fish, to me, is you must have good tartar sauce.  If it's crap you can have the best fish and you've still lost me as a customer.  KKL does it right....best, freshest fish and the best tartar in town.  A few have mentioned that it's not in the best neighborhood.  What does this really mean  Does location have some effect on a restaurants ability to cook food  Or does your concern for it's location say more about you...

1379,"Get the fish! Skip the chips! Few things are better than a made-to-order, hand-breaded, fresh, fish sandwich. This catfish filet was NOT frozen. The cornmeal breading was very crunchy. Cooked perfectly. Light, flaky, NOT greasy at all. Just a perfect sandwich all around. Get this, the combo plate was only $6.50. Seriously Awesome.When asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich, I replied, ""both."" BEST DECISION EVER! The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor. (Note: I'm not a big tartar sauce fan bc it hides the flavor of the fish).So, skip the fries. They're just frozen potatoes that don't taste like anything. I'm still giving Mandy's 5 stars, because the sandwich was truly exceptional. And honestly, didn't come for the fries. But ask them which sides are made on site. The onion rings and fried okra are probably good. PS-don't worry about it being catfish. It's seriously good.PPS-I grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky. No catfish has ever been this good. GO!

1382,"This location is isolated for being by the light rail. We stopped by on a Sunday at noon. There were no other customers at the time. The establishment is very clean and ventilated. The style has character and thankfully does not clutter the walls with kitchy decorations. The staff is very friendly as well as attentive. We ordered fried calamari rings and catfish shrimp combos with drinks. The prices are very reasonable, although there was a discrepancy on the chalk written price. The fish is freshly battered on the spot and the food is cooked in a timely manner. The batter and oil for each food item is specialized. The calamari rings were excellent with the marinara sauce. They were not too crunchy and not too rubbery, just perfect. The catfish came in three long strips over steak fries, three shrimp, and sides of sauces. Moist, tender, crunchy, and packed with flavor is how I would describe both the catfish and butterfly shrimp. The green tea reminds me of the imported teas in international markets in california. We will order from this place for office lunches in the future.
",others
1383,"Surprisingly empty during lunch hour. No frills restaurant located off of the 28th Street Washington light rail station. Had the three piece catfish meal with fries,  shrimp, hush puppies and a large drink for under $12. Meal is cooked to order instead of sitting in a bin under a heat lamp waiting for you. Generous portions, scalding hot, and unlike those other places comes with more fish than breading. Flavorful and great value. Definitely will be back.
",others
1384,"I stuffed myself...to an inappropriate level. Each piece of fish is perfectly crisp and fried. The oil is fresh so the fish is always light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

Go a little later in the evening, it is the classic ""pub"". I enjoy them both. I have been to restaurants and pubs all over Europe and the USA.  Sir Ed's ranks right up there with the best of them.It is a great place to go for a celebration or just to grab a beer in the evening. Draft selection is great, a true bonus if you like English beer!

1400,"Growing up in a family that didn't really eat a lot of fish, I made it to my 30's without actually eating a ""fish boil.""  Visiting Madison, I decided the right thing to do was to finally sample this regional delicacy.  A little research led me to the Avenue Bar, a place that will now always hold a special place in my heart.What's not to love  It's been open since the mid-fifties and probably hasn't changed much since then.  It is like a combo dive barrestaurant, and is chaotic beyond belief on the weekends.  Packed with families, blue hairs, the beer and a shot crowd, Lions ClubMasonic order-types and various other characters, this is the kind of place Archie Bunker would have been right at home at and I was as well.  You can just tell these people have been coming in here for 50 years every Friday night - it's fantastic! One of the happiest crowds I've ever seen, people love this place. I agree with the other reviewers - make a reservation.The food was fantastic - I had the fish boil, my friend had the fish fry.  Insanely good - I don't even know how to put it into words, but that fish boil still haunts my dreams. Cod, potatoes, carrots, onion all cooked together in one heavenly mess - it sounds weird, but dammit, you have to eat it to believe it.  Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  The fried cod was equally great,  it's a classic and they have it perfected here. This is artery clogging food at it's best,  I can't believe they don't make you sign a waiver before you eat here.Locally owned, great wait staff, very inexpensive, loaded with character - easily my favorite dining destination in Madison.
",others
1401,"Their Friday fish-fry is to die for (stick with the traditional cod). No wonder they've been voted as the Madison's 1 fish-fry favorites year after year. Call ahead and make a reservation if you are planning to go for the Friday affair. The place is literally packed. My friend and I got lucky and was seated at the nice booth seat right next to the bar. While waiting for our food to come, we got to watch locals enjoying themselves at the bar. My bloody marry was a perfect accompaniment to the cod. I think my friend enjoyed his martini and perch as well.

Very fun!Since being purchased by the Food Fight people, the Avenue has been different but the same.  The different is all good - cleaned up, remodeled bathrooms, spruced up all around.  Craig managing the bar is godsend for the Avenue.  The same is good too with nearly every staff member retained, great pours on drinks and good food and service.Most of the negative reviews on Yelp came at the tail end of the past era when things were not so good.It's really worth a try now.

Crowded and lots of lively conversation coming from the bar and restaurant. I came here for the FISH FRY. I heard it was top notch. They were right! Started off with an excellent New England clam chowder. There were substantial pieces of clams in the soup! Surprise, surprise! Very well seasoned. I did not even consider adding salt or pepper. I am sensitive to salt and it was not overdone. Next came the Fried Cod. It wasn't a Long John Silver's fry. It was more like a tempura batter. A light coating over two large fillets. I chose fries to accompany the plate. For a Friday night at 7:00pm, only had to wait 15 minutes. Very courteous and accommodating staff. Well, I will be back to try other items on the menu. But then again, maybe not. I have been to the top of the mountain! I like fish too. Give them a try.Johnny Chitown

It also has a really interesting ambiance, with a fun underground tunnel connecting the quieter, more formal seating in the Stone House to the more casual dining in the Stable Grill. For a night out with our family and a family of friends, it's a lot better to eat in the Stable Grill portion of the restaurant, rather than the (more formal) Stone House: the Stable is more suited to our boisterous group, but you'll still want to walk through the tunnel to the wine cave and the Stone House, just to look around if you have to wait for a table. (They do a brisk business, so it's best to call ahead.) Also, the cheese curds are only available in the Stable Grill portion (and the kids like these even better than the ones at The Old Fashioned, though the parents might split hairs on that one).

We will be returning and recommending our friends. There are two restaurants, but on Fridays both serve the fish fry. The bar doesn't take reservations and is first come first serve. Usually a 30 min wait, so grab a beer! If you don't want to wait jump over the house and there usually is seating available. We are hoping to experience the barn next time.

Try the stable first - bigger menu, more affordable prices.  The food: flavorgasm-inducing.  The service: friendly, prompt, and non-obtrusive.  The setting: interesting and relatively quiet.  They make a nice drink too.  On a Friday, try the combo plate of fish and thank me later.  Bacon-wrapped pork, beef medallions, meatloaf, chicken... I'm already looking forward to returning.
",others
1419,"If you ever live anywhere near Madison, you need to go to this place.  The bar in the stable serves drinks strong and perfectly poured.  Literally anything off the menu is going to burst with flavor.  The Stone House and the Stable Grill both offer really cool experiences; be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the two.I think Quivey's Grove is best enjoyed when you're planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table, preferably on one of those cold winter nights where it's so brutal that you can't stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door.  Quivey's practically exists to keep you warm.

1425,"you know that feeling of wanting to try something new and not wanting to settle for good-but-typical restaurants when you're visiting an area This place does the job for a good price.for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.fresh ingredients, so good.My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment oh yes pls. p.s. why is it so hard to spell prosciutto correctly

1426,"This is the kind of place that I would visit all the time if I lived nearby. The concept is solid (order what you want and it's written on your brown paper bag, and you pay when they call your name). I chose the spinach salad, which was great quality bacon, feta, and sundried tomatoes on a bed of spinach with a creamy mustard poppy dressing. People were so friendly here, that's what really made it worth it. There were plenty of tables available at noon on a weekday.

1430,"When we checked into the Plaza we saw this bar but didn't think anything of it and we weren't sure what it was. The appearance detours the place a bit, as walking by you can't see inside, so by just looking at it and comparing it to all the other bars downtown you wouldn't be able to judge it fairly by just looking at it.As I looked through our coupon book the hotel provided upon check in, there was a 2 for 1 drink coupon inside, and it was labeled the Drink. We weren't sure where the drink was, but decided to go hunting for it. We had to wait for our party to come down, so we made it our meeting point. We asked security where it was and they directed us to the bar we saw earlier.As we walked in and sat at the bar the bar tender was cool and made us anything we wanted. BTW check out the happy hour specials!The place was pretty big and very roomy. There is a good size stage, and a HUGE dance floor. There is also tons of seating. The vibe was sort of Rock n Roll with a taste of modern. A Nice balance.Long story short this place was happening by the end of the night. We felt very welcomed, and ended up staying here all night with our group. All the staff was super cool and friendly. At night a DJ came, he was awesome, and played anything the people wanted, and had a HUGE variety of music.

1431,"Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell ""General Tso's"" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.

1432,"We recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  I am unable to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  She was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  Never once did I feel unwelcome.  I will go out of my way to eat here again.

We weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  I will say this - they know how to treat their customers. We'll definitely be back :)

My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.

I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful!)

1438,"This is one of the greatest restaurants I have ever been to and I wish to god I had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really REALLY good meal I had here.  As soon as i walked in, I felt really special, which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but I'm not kidding...I felt like one of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids...really special.  The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant.  I was mesmerized.  Our waitress was a sophisticated, demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu.We were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...I would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me crying at the end of the meal.  Be sure to read the captions...The bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next ""Bold look of Kohler"" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).I might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like Pittsburgh, but quite honestly, I just need to shut up and visit her more often.

1439,"Soba Lounge appears to be the only sign of life in Shadyside.  Moderately trendy 20-40 something year old crowd makes the scene, and seem only too happy to make room for you.  Popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy Taco Bellesque dinner at the Shady Grove and it was the highlight of the evening.  I've been coming here off and on for years, and the espresso martini is my favorite choice, at only $8 per glass!  Comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent wines as well as the darling cans of Sofia champagne.  As a matter of fact, this is the only bar that I have seen offer these besides Coppola's restaurant in North Beach.  if you don't know what they are, it's the grown up girl's take on those Minute Maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch, and definitely a girly drink, but a bit pricy at $11 per can.  Next time I return, I plan to dine here and I can see Soba Lounge being my ""Bar away from SF Bars.""

1440,"MMM my hubby and I went there for the first time tonight.  Its probably our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  After they took our coats, we were seated on the 2nd teir looking across to the waterfall wall... We were there a lil early for dinner (530ish) So we were theonly ones upstairs, it was really nice... and quiet.  Service was wonderful and relaxed. First, ordered the corn chowder, and the lobster maki for starters. I'm VERY picky about sushi, hubby loves it, and he can rarely get me to eat it.  It was delcious!!  I'm actually craving more now that I'm thinking about it.  The corn chowder was also very tastey... but after 3 or 4 bites you're mouth needs some time to cool down!! Its got some kick, but a good kick :)  Ohh, I almost forgot the complimentary appetizer that the chef sent out... I wasn't really listening to her explain it, but it was some sort of delcious hummus on a truffle infused chip... AMAZING.  They should put iton the menu :)  For entrees, I got the pad thai and hubby got the filet.  Both were really good, the filet especially.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.  Hubby gobbled down the whole thing...  but i had to box up most of my pad thai... I think the sushi and the corn chowder filled me up... ANDi wanted to save room for a dessert.OMG.  We shared the frozen cashew terrine.  Orgasmic.  This will be our new regular place, i think :)

The one exception is the fried calamari - the plate was probably about twice the size it needed to be!The complementary small-portioned appetizer (I know there's a name for that, but can't think of it off the top of my head) is always been delicious.  The seafood is extremely fresh, and all of the flavors are very good.

1446,"I had read about Soba in Pittsburgh Magazine. I was intrigued when I saw that Soba was Numbero Uno according to a recent reader's poll. And doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city. With a build up like that, I was very excited to dine here. We had an early evening reservation. The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian. Looked like a homely dump to me. Inside was a very different story. Sleek and modern, with a Zen like garden feel, we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area. I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic. I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat. I was taken aback by the color, a sort of dreary garymustard. But it was very delicious, very spicy. My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens. We were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips. For dinner, we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot. The filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes.  The flavor was amazing.  The seafood looked delicious, I sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned. Dessert was also just as amazing. We shared the vanilla-roasted Asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit, Asian pear sorbet and sabayon. We also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan. It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly. All in all a very special evening. Everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good.  I have to agree with the readers of Pittsburgh mag.

1448,"If you like authentic Chinese food like me, you will love this place. I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here.I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.My favorite dishes are: Chinese style mapo tofu, Beijing duck (you need to order it ahead), fish with the spicy sauce (The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),  and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots.

1449,"I will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian Chinese food! Plus they deliver to my apartment.I got the Kong Pao Wheat Gluten & Veggie Lo mein. It wasn't excessively spicy, but enough to make it flavorful. I ordered this for myself....I had a HUGE plate of both with some white rice & a spring roll. I literally still have enough for 2 more meals. With a total of $22.50, it was the best quick & tasty Sunday dinner for a non-meat eater!

1450,"This is my favorite place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious. The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.I've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. My favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. The spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. My last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.China Palace is a win for sure!

1451,"My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the ""city that sleeps""). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area.

1457,"While staying in Uptown Charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner. Based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced, well reviewed, ready walking distance option from our hotel.  This one is rated with two $$.  Truthfully some of the best sushi I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.  I'm only on town for the weekend, so I have no idea if they run specials throughout the week.  I will absolutely come back next time I'm here, and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)

The ingredients make love in my mouth. Seriously. In my opinion, there's no need to try anything else.Service is spot on. Every time I'm there, everyone is very attentive, and you can't beat the area. I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile.

My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi! We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  And there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.But let's get to what everyone wants to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my ""go to"" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a ""must try"" on the menu. It's packed with spicy tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. My goodness. How could you go wrong with that combination  Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely worth a try!

1470,"My husband and I are frequent diners at PF Changs and we genuinely love it.  We typically steer-clear of chain restaurants, but we always make an exception for PF Changs.  We've been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal.  There are some dishes that we like better than others, but we have never had a sub-par dining experience.   The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent.My husband and I dined at PF Changs last night (Saturday night) and we brought another couple with us.  I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that I wanted (6:30).   When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking.  The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well.  We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes.  We started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends.  For appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn't have to share just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  Very nice way to start off our meal!   To me, it's those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.   The lettuce wraps were hot, fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!On to the entrees...Tuna Tataki Crisps for me.  They are so excellent!  Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together!  Mongolian Beef for my husband.  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dish.Our friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishes!For the table to share...Garlic Noodles (my favorite).  I CRAVE these Noodles!  The menu describes this dish as ""Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes"".  However, that description doesn't do it justice.  The noodles are tender, the sauce is savory, but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness, and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro.  Outstanding served fresh, even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!   I've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.Pork Fried Rice (my husband's favorite).  Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  For us, we don't like sticky fried rice, we don't like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  Chang's Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right amount of soy sauce.  Perfect!We completed our meal with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal.  Excellent meal, once again.  We all left full, satisfied, and happy.  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  Yes, we really love it that much.  The dishes may not be ""authentic', but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asian-inspired food.  For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend.  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, but the reliable friends are few and far between.P.S. I've posted pictures of the entrees.

I highly recommend the Shrimp and Broccoli, but really everything there is worth trying.Wait staff is very attentive, bordering on too attentive at times.  Food comes out fast and hot.  The owner is friendly and enjoys chatting.Good with large parties, there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your party.

1476,"My family has been coming here for over 20 years and I've always had a great meal. Great specials, diversity, and service. I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. The best egg drop soup I've ever had.
",others
1477,"The best Chinese place in Charlotte. (or Rock hill, SC) This restaurant should be tried by people that haven't liked Chinese food in the past because they do it right. My favorite is the beef and mixed vegetables. Ample portions, food (including the rice) perfectly cooked.Make sure (if ordering take out) to ask for some of the ""homemade mustard sauce"" to put on your spring roll or egg roll, it's great but be careful, it's HOT!

1478,"I'm not sure if the folks are reviewing the same restaurant that I have enjoyed since 1985. I live in Florida now but come back to Charlotte 4-5 times a year and the Great Wall is always a must destination. My order is always the same and it is always delicious- Great Wall Special Trio; spicy, no vegetables. Fried Rice and Hot & Sour soup.We have not been able to find good Chinese in North Florida. We would be so happy if we could get Chinese food the caliber of Great Wall!
",others
1479,"If you speak Mandarin, you can request whatever Asian cuisine your heart desires.  Bliss!  Since my Chinese is about as rocky as a kindergarten students', I like to drag my parents with me.  We always order up a storm- not exactly sure how to translate the dishes ordered but I'm sure you get the point.  This is as authentic as authentic gets in Charlotte (even some of the foods on the regular menu).  Absolutely love the owner, the wait staff, and the food.Step out of your comfort zone.  That's how you'll get to experience the authentic.  Junk like sweet and sour chicken is not authentic.  Have fun!
",others
1480,"Been coming here for years. Alex, Tiffany, Cathy and all the staff make me feel welcome. The food is always consistent and good. I generally take out but when dining in, the experience is always good. One thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks. These tanks are incredible and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy them.
",others
1481,"Been coming to the GW for almost thirty years!  Back in 1982 it was one of the few places to eat in the Carmel Commons area.  (Other than Little Ceasars, Mamma Rosas in Pineville & Chucky Cheese).  Yah, I'm old.  I remember when Winn-Dixie was still in Carmel Commons.    Family owned.  SUPER FRIENDLY managers.  Gets busy on weekends.  VERY fast take-out service.Once bumped into Jim & Tammy Baker during lunch. Standard ""American"" Chinese food.  Poo Poo platter fun with the flaming sterno cauldron.  THEY DO HAVE A REAL CHINESE MENU, but you'll need to ask for it.  Bar Area waiting.  Kids love the multiple fish tanks.  Fun place to people watch.  Don't worry if your kid spills fried rice all over the floor.  They won't fret about it.  Always ask for the house made mustard and duck sauce if you're getting take-out.  Bummed Baskin Robbins closed. . .as for years we'd stuff outselves on Beef & Brocoli and then waddle down for a pint of Mint Choc Chip.BE CAREFUL about drinking and driving.  CMPD and even Pineville patrol the area on a regular basis.  Better to get a cab than put yourself in that situation.
",others
1482,"I have been going to Great Wall since 1983. It has always been great and it's the restaurant by which I judge all other Chinese restaurants. It is consistent, reasonably prices, good services and delicious food. The staff is very courteous and I am always well served. If I ever do have a problem, they are more than compliant. Great place.
",others
1483,"I've been going to The Great wall of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the ""Crispy Scallops"". The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the ""Steamed Veggie Dumplings"" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The ""Crab Rangoon"" is okay. The ""Spring Rolls"" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the ""Sa Cha Scallops"" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back
",others
1484,"The BEST Chinese in charlotte. My boyfriend and I are regulars there. The food is amazing and the fish tanks are beautiful. If you are a vegetarian like myself they have plenty of option. I get the mixed veggies in brown sauce, SO GOOD!

1485,"This is one of my favorite places to eat since I was a kid growing up here in Charlotte. We still go there a few times a year as a family when we have a large group together. Great place for birthdays as well. Always seems like the food is consistent and has remained solid over the years. Ingredient quality is much higher than other Hibachi places I have been to. Service is accommodating.  Recently I have been hitting the sushi bar sometimes and we have been very pleased with the nigiri and rolls. We have tried some of the newer sushi places that keep popping up but have realized that we should stick with Nakato's.

",others
1489,"Been a fan of this place since they moved to Pineville from the Independence location. Over the years we gave celebrated many birthdays & anniversaries here . Food is always yummy. You get a lot - so if you leave Hungry - I wonder what's wrong with you ... The appetizer soup and salad are just the beginning - I tend to stay with basic hibachi shrimp and filet which are always wonderful . The fried rice is the all time favorite item for me ! The chef that cooks are generally as entertaining as you want - the more you engage them the more fun it is ! For me - hands down there's no better Japanese steakhouse in Charlotte. Food is fresh - seafood is yummy - entertainment is always good !

I wish I could get here more often, but something always comes up when they are open.I love their vegetarianvegan sushi options, it's quite impressive when compared to all the other places in Madison...Sushi Box has more than the standard choices that every place in Madison has.

1498,"Wow. I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked.  I've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it.  I liked it better when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy it at my leisure.  The owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon.The food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor.  I've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best Chinese food.I have always had at least adequate service on First Fridays.  The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful as the food.
",others
1499,"I heard about this guy Sarah K. went out with on 1212. They didn't quite click, but he sounded up my alley. We totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights. Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices. This is how I feel about Fate.
",others
1500,"I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about Fate, but here goes. The food at Fate is like a warm spicy Asian orgasm on a plate. The martinis send me to another level of heaven. Johnny Chu is a genius and  I will cry if he ever leaves Phoenix.I think that about covers it.
",others
1501,"I was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for Fate on here.  The whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco, but thankfully i've never had a negative experience there, and i've been there god only knows how many times.Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.).  He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was.  I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday.  It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular.  Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait.  It's not a big deal.  The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent, and the food was brought out ridiculously fast.  The crab puffs are to die for, and I honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best.  The pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good, but the spicy cucumber is out of this world.  I've tried a number of dishes, but I always come back to the spicy Saigon with shrimp.  I'm glad I don't live nearby, or I'd go there all the time.  This way it's always a treat when I go.
",others
1502,"I love Fate! LOVE it. I love Fate so much, sometimes I want to take it behind the school and get it pregnant!Their green tea milk is AMAZING. I go cuckoo for it. For reals! Their little mushrooms are so good too. Oh my god, they are like little mini mushrooms. If keebler elf's, harvested mushrooms, these would be it! So good! If it's your first time, trust me: get the crab puffs, grab yourself a cool refreshing hulk-alishist Green Tea Milk, and go for the Hong Kong flat noodles. So good! And what about those little wafer cookies they give you at the end They are like air! But better! (...they have calories...maybe they are not like air...but in a perfect world Like Air!)
",others
1503,"This is by far my favorite restaurant ever.I have been coming to Fate for about five years now and never ONCE have I been disappointed with the food or the atmosphere. We are normally pretty lucky and we get Heather who is SUPER sweet and a great waitress. I see reviews about people complaining about the hostess. Yeah, they can be snobby and make life difficult but it is SO worth it.I would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup. It is amazing. Unfortunately I recently found out it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing peanut sauce.I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so.The portions are always great, and you honestly CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists. Stay away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open really late on the weekends too.At least give Fate a shot once. If you don't like it I will let you punch me in the gut.
",others
1504,"I must say Fate was the only positive thing I gained from an otherwise awful date. The food was fantastic. I had the green chicken curry. It had the perfect mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish. I wasn't  expecting the curry sauce to be creamy. The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed the artistic ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly. I have read other reviews about the hostess's being rude...luckily I haven't experienced that. Even if I had e negative staff experience I would still recommend Fate for the food alone.

1505,"Yes!  This place was soooo good.  Several veggie options... delicious Yakisoba.  I'm looking forward to trying out their sister-restaurant, Eastwind.Went on a Saturday night and it was VERY busy.  I can't wait to go back, just not during peak hours.

1507,"After reading the reviews, I just had to check out the Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe.  I was not disappointed...What a crazy little place!  I went with my brother and a friend.  I had the yakisoba (noodles with vegetable and sauce), my brother had the Udon noodle soup with tofu, and his friend has the tuna.  All three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful.  We couldn't stop raving about the flavor.  Who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorful!The service was actually quite wonderful.  Our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like.  She also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket...banana bread, little cinnamon toasts, and rolls.  She also helped up each pick a desert :)Just an odd little place, Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth  Check it out :)
",others
1508,"My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for 4 years, so take my word it's authentic.The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavyoily for some people, so why not please everybody Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses."" Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)I think it's too small for groups over six.Maybe we'll see you there.Added 111807I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen.""Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.

1509,"You know how everyone has that go-to place to take visiting friends and other out-of-town guests...this is mine.  I've taken my sister and her boyfriend, my cousin and her boyfriend, several other couples, and they've always LOVED this restaurant.Located in an unassuming little stripmall on Camelback (because creative contemporary architecture no longer exists in Arizona), the Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is so tucked away, you'd never know it existed.  Even if you did, you'd never know it was so damn good.Any how, a friend introduced me, and I am in love with this place for the following reasons:1. QUALITY.The food is ALWAYS excellent.  I've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty.  2. VARIETY.My boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water.  The theme is noodles, so we encompass all Asian varieties and Italian as well.  They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc.  It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal.  Great desserts too!3. AMBIANCE.I always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland.  It's like a Japanese take on European provincial.  There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc.  It's just pleasant and romantic.4. STAFFThey've got that perky-Japanese thing down, even the non-Asian wait staff.  They're always smiling and helpful.  The girls are cute and perky. They're always just really nice people.So, come to the Cherry Blossom.  You can bring out-of-town friends and maybe convince them that that Valley isn't all Mexican or big-boxchain places.  BTW, since the place is small and intimate, small double-dating size groups are good, but this is no place for massive groups.

1512,"I got to do the ordering tonight... and it was a fabulous meal at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe! I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.For starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed  Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper ""tortilla"". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom's as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.My friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.With every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( http:cherryblossom-az.comcherry-bread.gif ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.Main dishes...I ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.I ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice. My friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella ""thing"" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!I had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I've been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!CherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.There was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men's room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room. Won't take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...And the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group. The interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....(I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It's CherryBlossom, not ""Cherry Blossom"". Take a look at their sign or their website.)

The menu is very extensive to say the least... I was very impressed by their hard-to-find fusion items, such as Ika Mentaiko pasta (squid with spicy cod roe).  If you have an eclectic appetite, I recommend you come here!  Though I've never tried any of their more typical Italian offerings, their sushi and Asian noodle dishes are delicious!

I was met with a ready smile and whisked through the store where one of the workers was gracious enough to assist me and cut small swatches of fabric from the rolls.  This store looks well stocked and I really appreciated getting the small swatches for free.  This location made it very easy for me to find what I was looking for. Thank you so very much Gene Sanes Upholstery.

1523,"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  She and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.My parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference.

You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches.

Even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd, the jewelry is beautiful.The aisles can get cramped with people browsing, but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see.

Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she ""kinda likes it"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door. Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile...

Printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  I think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker I am (brushes hair off shoulder), I never checked those out though I'm sure they're a lot of fun.  Their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.Middleton is really close to Madisonthe UW Campus and convenient to get to.

Pegasus was an amazing barclub to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it!

1545,"Hold up, time for an update on the review.  Still five stars, yes, but let me expand on it more than my two tiny paragraphs I had prior.Since I was there last they have done a remodel, a great remodel.  It doesn't feel so enclosed now.  Amazing what a bright color of paint on the wall and some new flooring can do for the way a place feels inside.  Also, big props for finally getting rid of the blinds on the only windows you have in the place (I have a feeling you used them to hide your embarrassment).  New floors and paint are not the only thing that was done for this remodel.  Remember those scary bathrooms  Yeah, no more.  They have nice, CLEAN bathrooms now.  The one thing that baffles me is the sink outside the bathrooms.  One sink.  Between the men's and women's bathroom.  Air dryer, no towels...weird, but it works.Another great thing was that they moved the pool table to the back.  To me, it felt like they were deterring you from entering on some nights.  I mean what would you think if you walked into a dim lit bar and saw some guys standing there with pool cues  With the moving of the pool table, it really does open it up at the front, more inviting if you will.Staff are still as nice as can be.  Polite and accommodating.$1 cover on most nights to walk in the door.  Yes there is a $10 minimum if you want to use  your card.*if you like karaoke, they have an odd little twist on it every first Thursday of the month.

1547,"The drinks are cheap and the music is pretty good depending on the DJ that night. Its not that expensive to get in, either. I guess you can kinda say I'm a regular... its the only club that I have fun at and the crowd is never rude - drunk of course especially on free draft beer night but never rude in my opinion. hahah  Its a nicely sized place. I've had waaay too much fun at this club!! They have three bars in total (one in the main room right by the big dance floor), one in 'Divas', and another upstairs when they have that open. If you wanna get some air they have a nice outside patio too.Lately I do have to say that the drag shows that I have seen have been kiiiinda boring to be honest but that's not what I normally go there for unless they have special guests.  Reading the comments I realize people are all like 'this place is shady' and, yeah, kinda is but I don't expect something fancy unless its downtown. *lol*The only thing I don't like is the creepy straight dudes that show up and lurk around, especially on Fridays. They really don't take a hint. But that's with every club in my experience, sadly. xD And in my opinion Scorpio is kinda more-so for the guys. I'm a queer female and I find it hard to spot the girls who aren't just their for their gay bf. I've gone on every day they are open but Saturday - my friends say the crowd can be kinda ghetto.House liquor is free on Sundays, free draft beer on Wednesday. Other specials are normally only 3 bucks which is good in my book!  I read on another review that the drinks were weak but like every bar if you tip them well your bartender will treat your right.  If your looking for something fun to do with no frills and no pretentious people this is the place.
",others
1548,"wednesdays and sundays are the best nights i think..ive been going to this club since i was 18, now 35... its a guaranteed good time! :) they have great specials on some nights its all you can drink draft, sometimes its all you can drink well drinks or vodka...with admission of course, which has almost always been $10... if you love drag queens check out sunday nights, its the most fun! :) djs have changed over the years, i dont know who is the dj now but i know there will always be some good music to dance my a** off to. :) been going here for years and will probably go for many many more. proud this is one of the oldest gay clubs in nc! :) go scorpio!

The draft beer seems to get you drunker than normal for some reason... not sure why.Great place even to bring straight people... my friends always seem to have a blast when they go.Just really needs better parking.

A little bit o' butch, a little bit o' femme, a few trannys sprinkled in as well as some music and a great and active dance floor. I despise country music- but it sure was fun watching these folks do a little two step and beyond (damn, they were good!). They did also play a little hip-hopTop 40 to mix things up.

They aren't trying to be something they're not (ZGirl club, take notes!), they're not pretentious and there's never a waitcover to get in.  The bartenders are chill and remember you even if it's been a long time.  I love Kat and the other bartender (name unknown to me) with the lovely silver hair who always asks ""what'll it be, babe"".  The music isn't exactly my style, but they do throw a few booty-shakers in amongst the country ballads.  I love watching the dance floor, as most of the ladiesgentsothers know how to cut a rug.

1558,"Trying very hard to be unbiased since this is my Saturday night spot for a year and a half now. The bar: I enjoy the employees attitude, the new country with some top 40, cupid shuffle, some throwback songs, and fairly priced drinks in this decent sized dive bar. For smokers, there's a large back patio area. An ATM is available in the darts room. Parking is in front, the back, or at Food City. The Cash has supported charities, held drag shows, and threw themed nights, like the most recent black out party, and  they also host poker games, dance lessons, and of course, karaoke. For busy nights, they have 3 bar tenders serving, 2 in the front and 1 in the rear. The crowd: If you're visiting or new transplant, compared to flashy Los Angeles, hipster Seattle, and melting pot NYC's lez scene (to name a few cities), I've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians, about an even number of femmes, tomboys, androgynous, and a small handful of ultra femmes. For the most part everyone's friendly. You'll see a wide age range here, along with some straights, gay boys, etc. I've also noticed a trend.... the Cash's bathrooms are never nasty and are always stocked with TP and paper towels lol.Come by, grab a drink, get your 2 step on, or twerk and grind, or just wiggle around... at The Cash, the Cheer's of Phoenix's lesbian population, and have a great time :)

1560,"The first time I went to Karamba's it was for Pride. I went for after hours and it was amazing! I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!

After 2 it turns 18and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. NOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind ofplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot moreeye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone.

This club is so good it has received the best of Phoenix Award several years in a roll, none of the Latino dance clubs have survived only this club because the owner knows what he's doing and provides great music and entertainment you have to go stop in and see this place if you're looking for a Latino club this is really the only place in Arizona to go.  Also the club has a food taco stand outside which is good and also an amazing outdoor patio that's absolutely beautiful it also has there are areas in the club that are sort of tucked away where you can sit with friends and drink and have a really great time. I am LMAO at all these little young tweakers who are posting bad reviews because they had a bad time give me break they have no clue what a really good dance club is all about, and their one time bad experience has nothing to do with the quality of a club.

It's a shame the place is rarely packed, because this very cool neighborhood bar has a lot going for it.Great bartenders! A supper friendly owner, and the best drink prices north of Van Buren. There is always a drink special and lots to look at with all the TV's and music Videos, a few old school Pinball machines, darts, a big stage and a pool table.I like going for some of the drag shows, this is the type of place with newbies and the old standards like Celia, Miss Ebony, and Phedra.I think ther is karaoke a few times a week and strippers on Saturday nights, I have to get back for that. On my last visit we were shocked because even though the parking lot was empty there was a fun lively crowd inside. We found out that alot of people walk over from around the hood, and from the huge uber-gay apartment complex next door.I dont live close enough to walk and I dont drink and drive so I dont get in as often as I would like to, but the last time I was there was 5 Stars!

Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.This place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.Also, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo.

Well I certainly can't handle my liquor but the drinks are poured well here. They have cheap cheap drinks and the first  time I was there, I think the Pink Panther martinis did it for me. They were only $4 too!Great place to gather a bunch of friends for karaoke. Yes its a gay bar but the coolest one. I've always met great guys there. They are never interested in me but they are always so nice and willing to sing a duet with me. The karaoke host is always fun, not a mic hog like some places. My only complaint is that my gay friends like to sing lots of show tunes. BORING! There are definitely some great performers here and but most are here to have a good time so don't feel like you need to belt like Whitney Houston to come here.

I recently moved to Charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here. The people here are some of the nicest I've met! The services are all mostly conducted in Chinese and the attendees are also mostly Chinese, so it can be very disconcerting for non-Chinese speakers. Don't be intimidated! Culturally, there are differences, but everyone is good people! :) On a day-to-day basis, the English is limited, but we definitely have quite a few English speakers dotted within. If you have questions or want to learn more, please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an English speaker. We are usually there on Sundays. Regular weekly service (usually group cultivation + meditation) is from 11-1. You can feel free to come by and observe, and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards. And you would be more than welcome to stay for lunch.There are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to English. Printed words only get you so far. The best thing to do is to track down an English-speaker and ask everything you've ever wanted to ask. There are no stupid questions, only ""teachers"" who may not know the best answer. :)Currently and at least through the end of the year (2014), we have a dharma class being taught in English from 1:30 to 3. It gets into some of the nitty gritty of Buddhism, so if you are a beginner, I'd recommend talking to someone before jumping into class. Either way, anyone and everyone is welcome.TBS is open to everyone, Chinese or not, and of any religious background!Our spiritual leader is Living Buddha Lian Sheng. Our dharma and our practice encompasses all Buddhist schools of Mahayana, Hinayana, and mostly Vajrayana. While other temples and societies may practice differently, we all believe in the same basic precepts of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

I have tried every soul food joint in Charlotte and around the united states and consider this one to be at the top of my list.  Where should I begin  We took our family of five here after church.  The children all ordered the fried wings and loved them.  My husband ordered the meat loaf, loved it!  I ordered the smoked pork chops, loved it.  Between the five of us we had green beans, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, turnips, rice and gravy and corn muffins.  They were all extra great with a special asterisk by the mac and cheese and sweet potatoes.  We continued on with the sweet potato pie and the cherry cheesecake.  Excellent, Excellent!  Extra ""woo woo"" that they do accept credit cards.  The price was reasonable because it included everything.  Our bill for five came up to $52.00.

I wouldn't call our music style quite contemporary in that when someone says ""contemporary Christian music"" I immediately think of Chris Tomlin, Brandon Heath, etc., and it's more of a gospel sound, if you have heard of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir our music is pretty much exactly the same.

We have wonderful ministries for people of all ages, in church, out in the community, and around the world with our great missions department. The most common drawback for people is how big the church is. With over 8,000 members (I of course don't know exacts), and plenty who are not yet members, it can be overwhelming for someone used to smaller congregations. However we offer a shuttling service for satellite parking at both Providence and Country Day School if you want to skip out on the crowded parking lot, and the bus drops you off right at the front door of our sanctuary. Also if you feel that you can't get connected because of he huge crowd in services here's where our said ministries on campus comes in. We have many different options with Sunday school classes you can attend, not just by age or ""single"" or ""coues, but also different subjects (which I don't really know off the top of my head). So come check us out, although we are a great place to worship I know it might not be exactly what everyone wants. Well what can I say I LOVE MY CHURCH!!!

1587,"Great church. Very diverse. The pastor tells it like it is.  The choir and music is awesome !!!  If I have to find a complaint, it would be sometimes its hard to find a sit because people save seats but the ushers usually work it out.
",others
1588,"It's a wonderful church! The pastor is straight to the point and is very honest about his own struggles in life.  He uses the pulpit to preach Jesus and steers clear of politics. He doesn't mince words about Biblical topics. The people are friendly and the choir is amazing.
",others
1589,"Spirit filled church; outstanding music.  The easiest (and not anywhere close to the whole story) description would be ""Pentacostal Lite"".  You're not going to see snakes or much in the way of speaking in tongues but if you are interested in a Church where Jesus is the center focus and worship is an active experience then this is the place for you.  Our family took a long time getting to visit here, but after going to many of the placid, dried up services at other places, we found this to be home.  Loran Livingston is Senior Pastor and gifted teacherspeakerminister.  The choir and musicians are world class and passionate performers.

1590,"The real deal!  If you like your Catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass, then St. Mary's downtown Phoenix is the parish for you.Originally built in 1881, it is the oldest Catholic Church in Phoenix.  Staffed by the Franciscans and located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix.  The masses are traditional, thoughtful and beautiful.  The choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family there-even as a guest.
",others
1591,"If you are looking for a classic Catholic church in Phoenix, this is it. St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.

1593,"While visiting in-laws for Christmas, I attended Midnight Mass at St. Mary's Basilica in downtown Phoenix, and it was one of the first times I understood why it is said that Catholics ""celebrate"" the mass.The Basilica is a beautiful piece of Spanish colonial architecture run by Franciscan Friars, crowned with bell towers, palms, and stained glass windows.The Christmas altar was lit with candles and bursting like a heart in love with the reds of dozens of poinsettias.Midnight mass lasted until 2am, but was so rapt with happiness, that few seemed to mind or notice. Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.The mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.The celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.By 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.Many, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy. Those who did were at least for a moment transformed by this eternity--this holy party which is Christmas.

1594,"i love this church!! I found it before i moved to phx and saw that pope john paul went here, how many churches have been visited by the pope in america not many!! Made my three wishes, and love that the door is always open to pray. Also the stained glass windows are amazing!! I go here after my downtown hospital rotations or if I'm in the area!! I also like that they have afternoon mass at 12 and a mass for the deaf how great is that!! love this place a must see phx jem!

1595,"We are staying downtown and had decided to go to Sunday Mass in St. Mary's Basilica, one of the oldest churches in Phoenix.  From the outside, it's an mission style stucco exterior, while inside, all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints, and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear.  Mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish.  It lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Considering the Church is downtown, there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist.  It's a beautiful old Church worth taking a look at.

1598,"I attended Mas here last Sunday and so happy I did! Sunday before last, I was dragged to Mass at The Franciscan Renewal Center and it was not joy. It was far too Liberal -- it's simply not my preference as a Catholic.Walking towards the Cathedral, you just feel a sense of history -- it's simply beautiful. I adore so many Patron Saints so I love all the decorated alters. Choir is simply amazing! Times keep changing...but I prefer to celebrate Catholic Mass in a more traditional manor. I attend St. Francis Xavier and Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church on a regular basis but will definitely attend Mass here more often.
",others
1599,"If you are in the Phoenix downtown convention area and you are Catholic, you owe it to yourself to visit this Catholic Church. It is a church like no other. Its beauty is breath taking from the outside and when you step into this holy cathedral, you get a sense of belonging and feel the spirit overcome your body. It is a sacred place and an experience like no other.

1600,"What the hell Yelp don't got Swish Awww hell nawww...Hehe that's my ghetto supa star!Ok so Swish is actually the first shabu shabu place in Vegas. I looked when I moved here. This was the only place. I needed something to get my shabu shabu fix taken care of. Shabu Shabu is when you get a hot pot of water or broth and you ""swish your meatveggiesseafood"" to cook it and eat. I have this thing with interactive food. I love to play with food. ""BE THE BOLOGNA SANDWICH!"" So you come into this strip mall not knowing this place is here. I'm sorry but this place was not easy to find. But yo support yo local businesses. The table setup is kinda cool. It's like a square counter with everyone having their own seperate hot pot. It's a very simple menu. Veggies, meat, kobe, or seafood. You get a healthy size....and a hungry size. They need like Hulk size. But then again this explains so many skinny asians. You can get a variety of apps from Edamame, seaweed salads, miso soup. But the good stuff comes in 2 forms Shabu Shabu form....or Sukiyaki form For dessert - have some Mochi ice cream and rub yer full belly. Mmmmm So this place did place in Best of Las Vegas Staff picks 2006. If you get lost it's on Sahara near Buffalo!Now I need to find a Japanese curry house....
",others
1601,"This place is hella badass! I eat here every time I go to Vegas because it's way off of the strip and I don't have to deal with drunk tourists. Don't be intimidated by the ""make it yourself"" portion. The servers are crazy nice and help you out the whole time. I was ""that guy"" and screwed up my order about 4 times before figuring out what I wanted and the servers were accommodating and gracious the entire evening. How can you beat great food and watching crazy Asian TV They were playing some show that's a mix between MXC and American Gladiators. So intense! I love this place.
",others
1602,"One of my all time favorite places to eat in VEGAS!!  Way off the strip, it's best to come to Swish, when it's not peak eating hours.  The first time I came here, I arrived right about the time they opened.  This turned out to be a good thing.  By the time my friends and I were finishing up with our leisure lunch, the place was filling up quickly and nicely.The layout is waaay cool.  A large U shaped counter sits in the middle of the room.  Sitting out the outer edges, your server will provide you with a gas grill and give you your choice of shabu shabu or sukiyaki.  Or, loosely translated - wet (soupy) or dry meal (grilled)  You get to 'swish' your food yourself.  If you give a stupid enough look, your server might be as sympathetic as mine and help you out with the cooking.  Luckily, I've done this before, so no stupid looks here!  At least, not in regards to getting my cook on.The average plate is slightly price, but it is well worth it.  The owner and staff are awesome and friendly.  I try to hit up Swish, whenever I get the chance.  You should, too!
",others
1603,"There's only one way to describe this place. Perfect. Ok so no decor. And yeah you cook it yourself. I don't care. I love it.There is a happy hour. But grr. I think it ends at 5. So grab a bottle of Sake. Order the Kobe Beef in the Sukiyaki and enjoy life.The tofu. The edamame. Everything. It is pricey. Yes. I wish it wasn't.
",others
1604,"This was the first REAL restaurant I ate at when I first moved here.  Then I ended up here 3 times in 2 weeks! I hear alot about price, but if you want quality, you gots ta pay for it!!!!  That said, the meat is good color, marbling.  The Kobe Chuck is definitely the STAR here, a bit darker in color, but the texture and flavor is hard to describe other than it's yummy for my tummy!  For the not so adventurous, there is the prime rib cuts, a bit smaller but still good.  they could be a bit more generous on the veggies, but then again I'm not here for the veggies...it's all about the BEEF!! The key to good shabu is the secret sauce, ponzu... you have to make your own lil sauce concoction with ponzu base, garlic, green onions, nanami togarashi (japanese pepper sprinkles,ask for it) be generous with it and a bit of chili paste.  add to the broth too....less the ponzu.  I'm not a big fan of the sesame sauce, but tasty too.  try not to overcook the meat, 10 to 12 seconds is all it takes.... can't forget to mention Angie and Marina, the 2 tallest asian girls ever, very nice and friendly....but watch out, 50% beer, sake 9 to 10pm and they just may have a drink with you.... til next time, good eating!
",others
1605,"I went to Swish for the first time last week and it was so amazing that I returned 2 days later and joined yelp to tell everyone about it. They have 2 portion sizes, one is healthy (smaller), and one is hungry. But the great thing is that if you do get the smaller portion you can add on just a little bit more at any time if you're still hungry. The place is pretty small, the counter is in a big U shape and your little hot pot is in front of you on a counter. The staff is really friendly and take good care of you. Happy hour is from 9pm till 10pm and that is 50% off, half of sake makes me happy. I had the Kobe Chuck and it is amazing, sliced so thin it almost falls apart. The chicken is amazing too. I'm just going to go ahead and say everything is amazing. They also have adorable bento boxes for lunch. They are vegetarian friendly which is very nice and the prices aren't that high. The Kobe chuck dinner is around $16. My only gripe with the place is they play some cheesy radio station all day.
",others
1606,"Very good place for shabu shabu.  If you are coming from the strip, make sure your cab driver takes the highway, it is much faster.  I had the Kobe chuck and it was very flavorful, with good veggies on the side too.  This place is a nice retreat from the crowded Strip restaurants if you want to get away for a while, and is the only shabu place near the Strip as far as I know.

The $13.99 Kobe chuck lunch special is hands down one of the best food bargains in this city ! Incredible. I also have to give major props to my favorite server there for always accommodating my obnoxious and bizarre food requests. Today he made me a custom plate of low carb veggies (mushrooms, asparagus, and cabbage) instead of the usual mix! Very cool of them to say the least. Also have to add they have alternate noodle options if you don't like udon - just ask! Prices are awesome and the servers will bend over backwards for you. Highly recommend, especially for lunch !
",others
1609,"This place is now on my list of, ""I don't care if I ate this earlier this week, I'll eat this again tonight!"" foods.  Yes, I know, that's not a very memorable or catchy list, but it gets the point across!  I think I have to get my sukiyaki fix every couple weeks, or else I start to crave it!When ordering your meal you're presented with several options: the type of meatchickenseafood, the portion size and shabu shabu or sukiyaki style.  Once those details are out of the way, food is brought to you almost immediately.  The waitress gets your stove going for you, and you're off!  Your choice of meat is brought out to you, along with an assortment of vegetables that include onions, green onions, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms and cabbage.  You also get some udon noodles and a bowl of rice.  Additional condiments are chili paste, radish and green onion that you can add to your broth.I've had the shabu shabu here before, but it wasn't something that I'll be eating again anytime soon.  The broth seemed quite plain and didn't seem to do much more than boil my veggies and meat.  The sukiyaki however, has won me over.  I love the sweetsoy sauce flavor of the broth itself, as well as the fact that the veggies and meat do take on the flavor of the sauce.  Bonus Tip: Checkout the front table by the entrance that has business cards and newspapers.  One of the newspapers is a Korean newspaper, and on the cover there is a coupon for Swish that gets you 10% off your meal! ;)

1612,"This place finally opened up and it was definitely worth the wait. The restaurant isn't very busy since not a lot of people know that it is open yet. The decor is modern, the music is fun, the place is very clean and they also have 3 big screen TVs. The restaurant is Asian Fusion mixing, Thai, Chinese, and Korean dishes. Having never been to a restaurant like this, the staff  was very friendly and helpful in explaining the different things on the menu. My friend and I decided to try the shabu shabu (hot pot), the grill and we ordered pineapple fried rice as one of our sides. Every thing on the menu is very reasonably priced. For the shabu shabu, you get to pick out 2 sauces to cook your food in, we picked coconut milk and the spicy chinese ones. You also get to pick out the different  tray of meats and vegetables you want to cook in them. Each tray of food is individually priced but very reasonable. We picked chicken, beef, mushrooms, and a separate tray of veggies, every thing was very fresh. We also picked Korean short ribs for the grill. We had a lot of questions for our waitress, she helped us cook all our food and came to check on us several times in case we had any additional questions for her.  For dessert we tried the mango sticky rice, it was very refreshing. I was very impressed at how good the food was and how much food we got for the price we paid. I would definitely recommend this place to every one. It is a hidden treasure.

1618,"So my friend and I got curious with Shabu Grill with all the good Yelp reviews.. And i must say everyone is right! Love this place! Everything is pretty much a la carte. My friend and I decided to do asian style and share our food together. I did the Shabu grill and she did the japanese hot pot.I really love the concept of this place. Pretty much all the meats and veggies are prepared and you can grab as much as you want from the fridge. everything is lined up and organized with all the meats and veggies. BE WARNED it is not all you can eat. they charge you per plate. average cost for a plate was 4.95$ for beef but the way my friend and i eat we racked up alot of plates and not even pay attention to how much we spent.The food is great they have an array of sauces you can choose from. I didn;t really use any of it because i already like the natural flavors of the meat i was grilling and as for my friend she loved her japanese hot pot.For those of youhave like authentic japanese you will be discouraged because the hot pot was not japanese at all it was more Chinese but we till loved it though.I felt this palce was really unique because it was Asian food fusion with all the other countries. The restaurant was a combination of japanese, thailand, korean..They are still in the works in getting the place together, they are adding a bar and tapas coming soon..I really love this place the food is great and the cleanliness of the place is excellent as well.The staff is great they fill your water up constantly and really friendly.I am a new loyal customer of Shabu Grill and will definitely return here.Try now! you will not be disappointed

It needed more spice for me, but I like it HAWT. BUT they do have like 6 diff sauces on the table and you can heat it up that way.The Thai Salad is awesome and big enough to share. Peanut dressing is to die for and the crunchy tofu is just right. It also has chicken and shrimp on it.I didn't try the Shabu but I'm going back at dinner time one night to do this. Best little neighborhood gem I've found in a while.Decor is pretty sweet too, parking was super easy, and they had Kaskade on.  Hours are 11 am to 10 pm. Couple of TV's inside but no sound on.

Our proteins were shabu beef, New York beef, pork belly, and shrimp. We also got some veggies and noodles. Chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night. You can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses. This would be a great place for the whole family imo. You can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook. We are already planning our next trip!

The wife and I had the Curry and Shabu Beef, Broccoli, Bok Choy and Rice Noodles. It was a winning combo!

1625,"I discovered shabu when I worked in Sacramento where there are several restaurants serving this style of food, but until now you haven't been able to get it in Phoenix which I why I was thrilled to hear that this location had opened... and close to my house to boot.For those who've never had it, shabu is an asian style of fondue, sometimes referred to as hot pot. Instead of oil, cheese, or chocolate each table has its own warmer to which they bring you a large bowl of soup broth in which you cook your food. You can even order two types of broth that come in a large container that is split down the middle.We ordered two, the base, house broth for the kids and a slightly spicier lemongrass broth for us. We then ordered a mix of items to cook including beef, chicken, tofu, broccoli, dumplings, crab, scallops, and noodles. When they bring the items, they tell you how long each one should cook and its helpful to arrange them by cooking time starting with the longest that take 3 to 4 minutes and working down to those that take only a minute or less.Once you have all of your food, the fun begins. My kids had a blast deciding what to try, cooking their own food, and eating with chopsticks.Service was excellent, our server stopped by several times to see how we were doing and to adjust the heat on our hot plate. The manager (owner) stopped by a few times as well to make sure we were having a good time and we assured him that we definitely were.The atmosphere was fun as well. It's decorated sort of like a club and they were playing a great mix of tunes, including stuff that we used to go out dancing to in the 80s and 90s... definitely a Bright Lights, Big City type of place. The manager even mentioned that they have a DJ in the Thai restaurant next door on Friday and Saturday nights.While we had a great time as a family, this would also be a blast for an adult night out on the town. If you've never had shabu, or you've been missing it in Phoenix, you definitely want to head on out to Shabu Fondue for an enjoyable time!

Most of other BBQ place either make them too salty or sweet or sour, etc... Just doesn't taste right. But in here you don't have to worry about it at all.Staff are very polite and friendly.

In this restaurant,  Lamb kebab is absolutely my favorite from the menu and mini hot pot is my second best choice. I also usually order three orders of onigiri instead of steam rice if I am tired of steam rice. I am glad that I found this new opening Eastern Restaurant that pretty fit to my taste.

Was told this is the place for great hot pot and bbq. Was very happy about the experience with this restaurants. The owner couple are very young, energized and friendly. Although the background music is a little loud, but I was focusing on the food too much. Don't go there after 7:00pm to mid-night over weekend unless you want to hang out with young Chinese crowd. They did offer different sauce for the hot pot, but you have to ask for it. My favorite is the the seafood hot pot.

1638,"This brings me back memories of Boiling Point in SoCal, the taste is almost identical! The whole time I was eating I was telling my fiance how much I LOVED it.  The service is kind of slow as they are pretty understaffed but the food overshadows that.  We got the spicy beef pot, seafood pot, and kimchi potSpicy Beef-  Pretty spicy for my taste, doesn't come with enough beef but fiance loved it.Seafood pot- was my favorite comes with a lot of clams, shrimp, crab, and some pork. Kimchi pot- comes with kim chi of course, hot dogs (asian hot pot staple, weird I know), and pork.  I am usually a beef lover but their pork cooks better than their beef does.  The takoyaki is not worth ordering... now this appetizer is normally crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  This one was just soft... flavors were there but texture fell flat.  We will be back every week!

1639,"I have found my new favorite lounge here in Scottsdale...and I don't have to drive down to Old Town!! Stone Rose is the innovative creation of the Gerber Group.  by infusing Scottsdale's nightlife with cutting-edge design, signature cocktails, and a dash of glamour - all within a unique indooroutdoor setting.A large outdoor bar is surrounded by couches and fire pits and beautifully landscaped.  The indoor portion of the barlounge has wooden floors and ceilings with black leather couches...making for a retro 1950's feel.Stone Rose is absolutely beautiful within the Fairmont Princess grounds.  With another NYC lounge opening here in Scottsdale, I am beginning to feel more at home here in the desert!For all you folks that live here in North Scottsdale, we finally have a poshlaid back lounge!

1641,"I've been to this place probably 30 times and it never ceases to have the tastiest drinks and friendliest bartenders in all of Scottsdale. Meredith, Steven, Fernando and Mike will make you a consistently delicious drink each and every time no matter what your taste buds crave! They're also hilarious and will have you smiling through each tasty libation. Be sure to check out the black raspberry martini and ask for the limelight. Feeling hungry The chicken lettuce wraps are amazing. You won't be disappointed!

1642,"First night out in Edinburgh and from a guide book we had The Dome was listed as a place for the deserving diners who wanted luxury. The building itself on the outside is nice, not impressive, but once you get into the place and past the hall your eyes just feast on the opulence of the restored interior of the Victorian former bank and the well designed bar area. They certainly added to the interior when the bar and restaurant was designed, someone really knew how to make the most out of this Victorian interior. We ordered our Tom Collins (perfect, great start when they get your cocktails right), and asked to see someone about possible seating in the dinning area. As the place looked busy we thought we would have to wait a while, but this was taken care off very swiftly by the Restaurant Manager 'Alan' and shown to our table by a very helpful waitress who applied the same high standard of service all night long, and we were in no rush. The food is as you would expect for a fine establishment, first class, also the service by the various staff was again first class. Anyone going to Edinburgh for work or play, treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience and go to The Dome, it's a must.
",others
1643,"Can't rate the food because I didn't have any, but what an amazing bar! The Christmas decorations are breathtaking, the staff is very friendly, and for being as beautiful and centrally located as it is, alcohol prices were very reasonable. Especially if you are travelingpassing through, take an hour or so to stop by this bar. You won't regret it!
",others
1644,"Now The Dome is marvelous and situated in a beautiful building. But I must point you in direction of the Garden Cafe, which is the outside cafe area located at the back of The Dome. The same fantastic food but outside in the sun! Entrance is via Rose Street so don't wander inside The Dome and get lost like we did.My Gran and I sat outside here one day and enjoyed a fabulous lunch. We both had Caesar Salad which was delicious, as well as sharing a plate of chips. My Granny just loves chips so its great to get my carb fix. For dessert I had Sticky Toffee Pudding which came with the most refreshing Coconut ice cream. It had homemade shortbread too. It really was to die for and the highlight of the meal. While we were eating it started to rain and all the waiters hurried around us erecting these huge umbrellas. It was fun to watch and it felt like we were in a tent once they had finished. The Garden Cafe is only open in the summer months though, so it is great for that time of year. Otherwise I go back inside to The Dome which never fails to impress with the amazing surroundings and wonderful service.

1645,"Every Christmas, my mum and I get butterflies about going to The Dome. If you've seen the Christmas wreaths wrapped around the pillars, you'll begin to see why, and if you go inside you will understand completely. It's like they have a room spray of all the Christmas smells and keep it constantly puffing out in plooms of fairy dust and laughter. Every year I have to catch my breath when I go into The Dome, because it is quite simply breathtaking. The decoration is beautiful and the whole atmosphere is electric.Even when it's not Christmas, The Dome just has a magical feeling about it. It's like a fairytale. Yeah it's a bit pricey but worth every penny. You can't go to somewhere like The Dome and not expect to pay for it. It's also a hot-spot for celeb-spotting (although the amount of celebrities in Edinburgh is extremely limited).
",others
1646,"The interior ""Dome"" is magical.  I thought maybe it had once been a church, but it has been converted from a bank.  We just had drinks, so I cannot comment on the food.  Their Christmas decorations were breathtaking

1647,"Was at this fabulous restaurant last night with clients. Thursday night in Edinburgh and at 8pm it was packed, when we finally pushed back from the table at 1115 it was still packed. In Portland on a Thursday night at 1115, just about everything is closed. The room itself is fantastic, converted from an old bank, it is incredibly ornate with a huge stained glass dome hanging over the room. Yes I did have the haggis, wrapped in phyllo as an appetizer and it was amazing. The rest of the meal was of equal quality and the service was impeccable. If you find yourself in the Scottish capital make your way to the dome

1648,"Yes, the place to take your friends from abroad to show off some granduer of Edinburgh! I like the time around Christmas when they go all out and install the theme to the max. Decorated pillars outsite Check! Massive tree in the main bar  restaurant Check! Good atmosphere, friendly waiting staff and free nuts or haggisballs! Check, check and check! It is a good place to start of your evening on George street (if a little expensive) You will be well impressed.

1649,"First time in the Dome and will be paying another visit soon, cannot rate highly enough such an amazing place at Xmas. Decorations are superb they have spent a lot of time and effort to get it looking this good, it even smells like Xmas due the amount of cinnamon sticks intertwined within the decorations. Never had time to dine but sampled a few cocktails and they were top notch, bit pricey but worth every penny for the atmosphere alone.
",others
1650,"Beautiful restaurant and very good quality food - possibly the best we had there while on a recent trip. The server did not have a good command of English which doesn't bother me from an ethnic standpoint but makes it difficult to communicate. In fact, Edinburgh seems to be populated by foreign guest workers and oddly, they are almost all in service positions. Must be plenty of jobs there and I'm guessing low unemployment rate Anyway, I digress and again want to state how opulent this place is. And the food presentation matches the surroundings!

1651,"WHOO HOO !!!  Just heard The Dome is putting up its Xmas decs next weekend. Must be the best place in town for a Xmas night out. Always make a point of popping in to see it

1652,"You'd be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place, tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street, but in my opinion that's half of it's charm. It's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality, not because it's in your face.It's easy to see why. When you step inside it's like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace, with the green leafy plants and water feature. Rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it, next to the fresh flowers, and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusive.Although it's never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh, you do get what you pay for. That said, at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their ""Better By Half"" promos on: glasses of house wine, selected cocktails, selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment. I've been making the most of these offers every time I'm out for fear that they might finish soon, but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet. Happy Days.I've only ever drunk here, but one of these days I will be going for food... the plates I've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous. There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz, but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof.
",others
1653,"In the last 6 months Ricks has definitely had a good shake up, and after my fantastic experience last week I think things can only get better. The bar team are innovative and original and during a busy Friday night shift never failed to impress me as I worked my way through the new cocktail list! And the bar snacks were unique and delicious! The DJ provides a funky relaxed atmosphere and gradually builds up the beats to get you in that weekend mood! I will be back again and again and will be taking all my friends too! I recommend a passionfruit frozen margarita or 'busy with the fizzy' strawberry soda stream cocktail! Just fab!

1654,"This bar is a life saver after all day of walking at the Sands convention center. This is a nice place to sit and enjoy a cigar, have few drinks. Drinks are moderately priced, service is excellent if any downside I can think of that will be to find a seat right after the closing of a convention when you can get run over by stampede of tired and thirty convention attendees. I love this bar and of course will visit again.

1655,"Amazing new restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter.  This place has it all, great food, great ambiance, great selection of champagnes and wines. I went there New Years Eve on their second night open and had a fantastic night.  The room was breathtaking and the people there were great, not to mention the service was right on!  Haven't been to any other club in town that has the feeling Narcisse has!  Do not miss out.

1660,"Newly opened in the chic and trendy Scottsdale Quarter, Narcisse is an opulent champagne lounge that feels like it's straight out of Vegas. So much so, that they've got velvet ropes at the entrance. Fortunately, the doormen waved us right through so we didn't have to endure a wait.Once inside, we found ourselves in a gorgeous space filled with gorgeous people. Everyone was dressed to the nines and the crowd was mostly in their late 20's to late 30's, with a dash of cougars and manthers. The DJ on Saturday night was spinning fun hip hop and dance beats, but my girl friend and I seemed to be the only ones who let loose on the dance floor. Sure, sipping champagne is sophisticated but stop being so stiff, people!Definitely a chic spot to lounge with friends, mingle with strangers and dance the night away. There's a great outdoor seating area as well, with lots of heat lamps set up, so we also enjoyed hanging out there and meeting some really friendly locals. They serve up a huge selection of champagne as well as beer and spirits, but you really can't come here without popping a bottle. VEUVE!

1661,"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!

1662,"This is my new favorite place in Scottsdale!  First of all, I love champagne so any bar that is a champagne lounge, gets my vote!  The service was good, the champagne selection was vast and the atmosphere was totally amazing - the decor was eclectic and so unique!

Everything is elegantly plated and tastes really fresh.The nightlife is upscale, but a little Scottsdale-homogenous - everyone seems to look the same. If that's the scene you crave, then Narcisse is the place to be!Hm.  Now I want breakfast food and champagne...

1664,"Finally made it to Narcisse on Friday night and found the place quite fabulous. With it's glam decor, comfy seating, and pretty views I was a happy camper. I got served my drinks very fast each time I ordered,  the music was pretty loud but still enjoyable, and the crown was attractive, friendly in the late-20's to early 40's age range, which is just right for me.  It's nice enough to wear heels and a little dress, or even jeans and a cute sweater. It was not overly crowded, nor did we have to wait in line to enter so nice job Narcisse! I shall be back for Sunday Brunch to take advantage of your $10.00 endless bubbly's!!

We even ordered some food to munch on and it was DELICIOUS. we got the tuna tartar a chicken salad and some pork stick things that were great portions and very tasty.  Plus the service never faltered and was super impassive for being PACKED and opening night.All in all...I was IMPRESSED and for SURE going back.

Oh, and the boobs in my face.Our bartender A.J.  took great care in muddling my Jefferson (5 stars) and Sharman's Mint (how can you go wrong with a drink named after the establishment) while entertaining us with an infused vodka taste test. My new favorite drink was discovered last night--ginger vodka press: run, do not walk to your nearest liquor dealer.The tapas were ultra cheap and tasty, we took down the tuna tartare and  fried wontons and there are several others I would go back for.  These two items were the perfect base for our evening ahead.  I want to return for the Bubbles- The Gold Digger. Eye candy of all ages, dress to the nines for this joint!

1667,"Finally a nice upscale establishment with a Vegas feel in Scottsdale. Great decor, professional and attractive staff, all around a great environment. I am surprised at some of the comments on here that are negative. Clearly those people have never been to many clubsbars. The door hosts are some of the best in the state. Anyone that has ever been to a hot night club knows if it is busy and you want to get in quick be extra nice to the door staff not act like a moron with an attitude. If you don't want to wait in line get there early. It's also nice to see a place with a dress code so that guys actually have to look some what respectable an not like a bum wearing shorts an flip flops. Use your head fellas your going out on the town not to a pool party, have some pride in the way you look. The Mint is top notch, thank you for a great time every time. I am a fan for sure.

1668,"Our Group has enjoyed being a little spoiled at this venue. The staff is always willing to accommodate our large group (of possibly louder than normal Queens. I mean temperamental. Wait, I mean, well-mannered gentlemen).Our bartenders have taken care of the random requests we somehow always seem to come up with after a few drinks. And the taller gentleman with the buzz cut and Amazing Arms can take my money any day. He is HOT!!!If it is a late night drop in just before we call it a night on a Saturday of Thursday the back rooms are a blast to shoot the Sh!t in. Or an early visit to start off the Sunday Funday up in front in one or two of the booths they have available. The Mint will offer a fun experience and I recommend making time to visit the powder room!!!

1669,"I spend a few nights a week in Old Town, and will always end up at The Mint.  Their door staff, bouncers, and VIP hosthostess are all very nice and have spoiled me to no end, lol!  I like the more upscale vibe here, and was reminded of how well this club sets itself apart from others when I visited another venue just around the corner a week ago.  The D-bag factor was HIGH at the other club, not so much here.  It seems they actually pay attention to who they are letting through the doors at The Mint, which is a welcome reprieve from a lot of clubs in Old Town.  I saw one reviewer's posting about all the seriousness of The Mint's clientele...and while I've witnessed this a couple of times before, I attribute it to what I've experienced in other clubs:  I just get worn down some nights by all the 20-somethings getting flat wasted, making a scene, or hitting on me (I'm 42) and after a solid evening of that I just might be a tad antisocial myself, LOL!  But you generally don't find that at The Mint.  It's a safe place to hear great beats, hang out with good friends, and make a few new friends as well!They have a very good menu too, and I suggest going before club hours to sample it (although their kitchen is open during club hours as well!).  The Mint will ALWAYS be my go-to spot, and I always suggest it to visitors.

1674,"So I came on a Saturday night and this place was - amazing! I have been to almost all of the clubs in old town and I have to say this is by far one of the best.I always go mainly to dance and this place was packed and everyone who was on the dance floor danced! Sometimes people are mingling on the dance floor, talking, or only slightly putting effort (in other words, taking up prime space) but people here actually danced! It seems silly, but this is amazing. It encourages other people to do the same and gives a highly energetic vibe to this place. Very attractive. Like people just don't give a f*** and want to have a good time. That's exactly how I like it.The atmosphere was not only created by the enthusiastic crowd but the incredible lighting as well. Ethereal is the best word for it - not too dark, not too bright for the dance floor, and then outside of the dance floor, just bright enough and yet still somehow maintained very low-lighting. I'm not sure how they achieve this balance, but I'm pretty sure it's magic. The decor, appearance, and condition of this place is absolutely gorgeous. The way it was designed is stunning, like a Victoria Secret's model - glamorous, sexy, laced with elegance, and bejeweled with luxury. I also love the layout of this place. Once you enter, you hit the dance floor, which is circular like Maya's, those are the best (between the people and setting, it was the most comfortable dance floor I have ever danced on - people who just wanted to have fun, danced, were very attractive, and chill). You can then go around the dance floor to the bars to get a drink or continue all the way to the back to get a break from dancing. Back there is an extremely nice lounge area where you can lay back, relax, and have a drink and chat. I can't express how much I love this large lounge area in the back, I adore it, I adore it, I adore it. It has so much space, room, and (comfortable!) seating with intimate couches and spinning chairs and it's like a glamorous, long, break room or like another club all together. Yes I love dancing, but hell I need a break for water and a chat too! The bathrooms are back there as well. For those that need it, there's also a long and large outdoor patio with seating.By the dance floors there are actually platforms which you can stand on and dance on, sometimes my friends and I dance on them. They're really convenient when the actual dance floor gets too crowded and you can just hop on one of those. But I do believe they're actually for the go-go dancers that come on Wednesday night. Oops, owell haha. Alright, so I actually did not order a drink here or use the bathroom which are kind of my requirements for giving an honest to goodness complete review, so I'll be back to update on drink prices and quality and whatnot. Honestly I just danced the night away this visit, and loved every second of it. WILL BE BACK. Love you Mint. Oh yeah, and the cover charge for men is $10, while women pay nada. Woo. Love it. The lines were rather short, I think I waited 10 minutes tops. And the people at the front were very friendly and nice, no attitude whatsoever.Possibly because of the cover charge, there were more women than men - whoa rare I know, and there was a variety of ethnicities, so all in all, great mix. In addition to that, it was the first time where I had seen more than 3 attractive guys at a club, haha. Lots of attractive people here, men and women. I don't know what it is but I guess a good looking and feeling club attracts good looking and feeling people. How else could you explain it. First and only club I've seen so many good looking people!I'm coming back here asap. Next weekend. Doing this. Every weekend. If possible. Sorry Maya, Smashboxx, and INTL, but I found a better lover. We can keep it an open relationship if you'd like. I don't mind.

I'm big on music and dj was on fire all the latest music. Mostly hip hop which I love cause let face it who wants to watch strippers dance to Taylor swift or sum bs. Drinks where kinda pricey, I would def pregame b4 going. But tha girls where on point. Shoutout to blue. She had me on cock diesel all night.

1677,"Champagne is my drink of choice, morning, noon and night. Having Perle so close to my job could present a real problem for me.  With cocktails running around $8.00  and with the staff being so damn charming.  I could easily see myself there at least 3 nights a week, *cha-ching. Downtown champagne is hard to come by. I can count on one hand the number of bars Downtown that even serve it.  Perle is for sure a dream come true for some one like myself. The service here was top notch the waiter, DJ and chef both chatted me up and the bar tender even offered me suggestions on things I might enjoy. I like the lay out of the lounge and I think that a lot of thought want into planning the interior design.  The marble bar also really appeals to me, I have never seen anything like it before. The DJ Leah upon noticing that I was using my e-cig at the bar came down and was very sweet to chat with me and was encouraging since I have been trying to quit smoking.I had the mango ceviche that was so good I had to order another tapas so I had the California too. The mango ceviche was shrimp and salmon with mango, and red onions and cilantro and served with lime wedges. The baby face chef was a little chubster and super sweet to come and inquiry about the dish. All and all I had two tapas and three cocktails, a cham cham, a mimosa and a red rose bud.  My favorite was the cham cham. I will certainly be back to get down with the get down and get my champagne on.

1679,"So I went here for a co workers birthday party a few nights ago. I must say it's a very nice place. They have leather chairs and sofas all over the place. The lighting is very appropriate for what vibe they are trying to give off here. Drinks are a little expensive. But almost every person including myself was dressed up. Woman had dresses on and man wore suit jackets or dress shirts with ties. The door man wears a tux. The deserts are amazing that's all we had on there menu so I can't tell you much about there other food. The service was fantastic we had our own waiter who only was serving the birthday party. If you want to celebrate a promotion that you got from work or are going out on a date with someone you've been with for awhile I would definitely recommend this place. A lot of couples go here from what I saw so maybe not for someone who is single and I went on a Saturday but the place does get packed so you'll have fun regardless of who your with. They have a jacket check which is nice. Overall I will be going back o this place 5 stars in my book.

They were kind, courteous and even hooked the system up for me in store so I could ensure that it works.

I would recommend EZ Pawn to anyone, even those who are first timers like myself. Five stars, who knew pawn shops were so nice :)

1691,"Thank you Liberty Pawn! I was recently in a bind and needed some cash. The only thing I had of value was an Apple product - and I needed back the following week. I tried 2 places before finding Liberty. I went to a small private shop that held you to the 3 month term, not letting you pay in full early. Forget that. Then there is the famous Super Pawn...I hate them. Not only are they the most awkward people ever, they do not give you fair value for your item. Thankfully, I found Liberty. The staff was genuine, super friendly and honest. They take pride in their business and are very fair with their lending practices. If I'm ever in a bind again, I will definitely come back.

1692,"One of two places to check out whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. For such a small space, Paul's is incredibly dense. They have this unique carding procedure where they keep all the new CDs behind the counter and you bring the card up to the counter to get it. They usually have an amazing used CD selection as well. Plus, they have MOJO and UNCUT magzines flown in from the UK and you can usually get them about a month before Borders does! On most days Paul himself will be there. They are also very plugged into the local scene, as far as what they carry. I rarely leave here without a few amazing finds!

1693,"One of the first things I did when I had a little free time after moving to PIttsburgh was to locate a good CD store.  Paul's definitely fits the bill.  A small but extremely orderly (re: alphabetized!) shop.  I knew what I was looking for, otherwise I could have spent an hour browsing.  Genre sections are clearly labeled and easy to find.  Right when you walk in, you'll find a rack of the newest releases on your right hand side.  After I had acquired my bounty of Wolf Parade and Stephen Malkmus discs, it was time for the final test... having a chat with the staff.  The experience was good - they are friendly and very knowledgeable, and I can look forward to asking them for recommendations.

1695,"Paul's is my favorite record shop in town! As others have noted--it's not a big place, but it is chock full of (well-organized!) stuff! They have a wide variety of music and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They know about *music,* not just one variety and they've never been condescending or rude. If they don't have something you're looking for in stock, they'll gladly order it for you, and they were very helpful when I was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on CD. If I can't buy my CDs straight from the band, Paul's is where I go.

1696,"update: Paul's is turning into Sound Cat.While I've only been here a couple of years, I find that Paul's consistently has the best selection of new CDs if you have vaguely discriminating music tastes (non-mainstream).  Very wide array of indie music.  Not just your standard indie poprock, but also avant-garde, ambient, etc.  My purchases are ~70% planned, plus a bunch that I spotted while browsing.  Sometimes I'll even see an album here that I wasn't previously aware of and check it out online, then go back and buy it.  Every time I've been here, my reaction is ""Ooooh I can't believe they actually have this"" at 10+ albums; then I have to consider my budget and only buy 2 or 3 at a time.Will definitely continue to go when it's Sound Cat Records.  Strongly recommend.
